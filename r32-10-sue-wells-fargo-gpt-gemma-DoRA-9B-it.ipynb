using the Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) version of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), on a free-tier Google Colab GPU.  This approach allows for efficient customization of Gemma-2 for specific tasks without the computational overhead of full fine-tuning. The basic concepts are discussed, but this notebook is meant to be a practical template for any developer at any level to be able to \"just plug and play\" without needing a PhD in math to do it.\n","\n","- This notebook creates a custom LLM for doing research for writing legal documents for lawsuits against Wells Frago Bank, NA and similar organizations.\n","- It is not perfect, but it was trained on all cases in the last few decades that show up in courtlistener.com where Wells Fargo lost on at least one count in the case in US federal court.\n","- If you are an attorney representing a counsumer or small business against Wells Fargo or a pro se litigant lookin g for answers, the resulting model https://huggingface.co/david-thrower/sue-wells-fargo-gpt-2-2b-it may be a great resource for you.\n","- Questions like \"The bank claims that since I didn't answer their motion, I admitted to something. Help me!\" or \"What rights do I have in dealing with my credit cards or home loan?\" are all fair game for this model.\n","- This is for research only and should not be relied on for composing your argument or writing the final papers you submit.\n","\n","## **The Problem: \"Off The Shelf\" LLMs are great, but they are jacks of all trades and masters at none:**\n","\n","Gemma-2 offers impressive performance, especially for its size, excelling at code generation, complex question answering, and following nuanced instructions.  The quality of its writing, quality of the explainations it generates, and \"human - like\" writing style is also rather impressive. However, like other pre-trained LLMs, its performance an a niche task needs to be enhanced a bit, and that is where fine-tuning on task-specific data comes in.  Traditional fine-tuning is computationally expensive, involves thousands of dollars in compute resources, and leaves a gaping carbon footprint, making it impractical for many users.\n","\n","## **LoRA: A second Generation approach to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Solutions:**\n","\n","- LoRA addresses this challenge by freezing the pre-trained model weights, in other words, basically leaving the existing model as is, and training a small set of new weights that are added in parallel to some of the model's layers.\n","    - **The benefit:** This drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters, enabling efficient fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. This provides almost as good accuracy as full fine tuning, and requires as little as 1% as many compute resources to accomplish.\n","    - **The drawback we really want to avoid here:** The models that classic case LoRA produces is usually lower than that of full fine tuning.\n","- **For advanced users:** these adapters are low rank matrices (adapter weights) injected along side specific layers, usually the query, key, and value feed forward layers.\n","\n","\n","## **DoRA: A 3rd Generation approach to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Solutions that we will use here:**\n","\n","- Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) builds upon LoRA by adding a matrix factorization that improves the accuracy without much additional computational expense. You don't really need to understand what is happening under the hood to use it. This template will is fairly robust and should work reasonably well on a lot of data sets.\n","    - **The benefits:** Like conventional LoRA, we are leaving the model's original weights as - is and only training adapters that were added that account for less than 1% of the model's weights.\n","    - **Unlike conventional LoRA, DoRA will often create models that are equally as accurate as those done by expensive full fine tuning**, and if not equally accurate, very close to it in most cases if done correctly and carefully optimized and on the right training data.\n","- **For advanced users:\"\" What is happening is that DoRA incorporates orthogonal constraints on the adapter weights. This technique decomposes the updates of the weights into two parts, magnitude and direction. Direction is handled by normal LoRA, whereas the magnitude is handled by a separate learnable parameter. You can read more about it on the resources below, but to stay true to the scope of this notebook, to serve as a practical template and guide to arrive at a proof of concept or MVP custom LLM that can be refined later by advanced users if need be, we refer you to the paper and other academic materials rather than go deep into the details.\n","    - https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09353\n","    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2WzLS9TggQ\n","\n","\n","## **Why This Template?**\n","\n","* **Practical, Plug and Play:** If you don't understand the theory discussed here, no problem. If you understand the basics of Python and follow the instructions, this template can be easily used to fine tune your own custom LLM without any cost to you to do so. If you are a developer, you can use other tutorials to integrate the model you create into a chatbot UI like one of these to make a practical app.\n","    * https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/chatinterface\n","    * https://reflex.dev/docs/getting-started/chatapp-tutorial/  \n","* **Scalable:** Easily adaptable for larger Gemma-2 models (2B, 9B, 27B) by simply changing the `model_name` and running in a suitable environment with more resources.\n","* **Simple and Customizable:**  Provides a clear and concise code structure that can be easily modified for various tasks and datasets.\n","\n","\n","## **Getting Started**\n","\n","1. **Hugging Face Account and Access Token:** Create a Hugging Face account if you don't have one and generate an access token.\n","    1. Account Setup: If you don't already have one, head over to the Hugging Face website (https://huggingface.co/). Create a free account.\n","    2. Token Creation: Click on the button to generate a new access token. Give it any name and select the following checkboxes to give it the required permissions under the **repositories** heading:\n","        1. Read access to the repos under your personal namespace.\n","        2. Read access to all gated public repos you have access to.\n","        3. Write access to the repos under your personal namespace.\n","        4. After this, click **create token** at the bottom of the page. Paste this into a text editor, but do not save it to a file. You will need it shortly. Treat this as you would a password.\n","2. **Colab Setup:** Open this notebook in Google Colab and ensure a **A100 GPU** or higher is selected (The 2B default model will run fine wiht the free tier T4.).\n","    1. Under **\"Runtime\"** tab -click  **\"Change runtime type\"** then select **\"A100 GPU\"**.\n","3. **Access Token Secret:** In Colab, to the left of this notebook there should be a **key icon**. Click it. Click **create new secret**. Name it `ACCESS_TOKEN_HF`, use this exact name with the same uppercase and underscores. Paste your Hugging Face access token as its value, and switch the toggle switch to save it. This protects your token and passes it to the notebook so the code has access to the required resources on Huggingface.\n","4. **Customize the Training Data: (Optional: You can run this notebook as is, and see this toy example run and work, but it is easy to make your own data set to solve a real problem you want to solve with a customized chatbot / LLM)**  Modify the `train_data` list to include your own dataset. Follow the provided format: `{'input': 'Your prompt or question', 'output': 'Desired LLM / chatbot response to that prompt or question'}`. Each training example is a Python dictionary that shows an example of a user prompt and a chatbot response to that prompt.\n","    1.   The value associated with the \"input\" key should be an example of a prompt or a question that a user may want to ask the chatbot.\n","    2. The value associated with the \"output\" should be an example of a response you would expect the chatbot to write if someone asked the chatbot that prompt or question.\n","    3. Most likely, examples of prompts and responses will consist of multiple - lines of text. No problem. Just replace the line wrapping with `\\n`, so each example can be on one line and a chatbot UI will know that this means to wrap the text as a new line.\n","    4. Ensure you have a sufficient amount of data for effective fine-tuning. A few hundred to a few thousand examples is recommended for ideal results, but we don't always have thet much, and that is OK. As little as 50 examples may be of some benefit, but the more examples you have, the more effective your custom chatbot will be at being true to the task you are training it to do. Use as much data as you can find and have the time to load. The vanilla example we ran only has about 100 examples, and as you can see in the results of running this, it was successful at modifying the model's behavior. Keep in mind that the more complex the instructions you want the model to be able to follow, the more exapmples it will need to be effective at the task you have in mind. Just make sure the samples follow the format:\n","        1. `{'input':`\n","        2.  **\"then a the example prompt or question in quotation marks\"**\n","        3. then a comma `,`\n","        4. then 'output:'\n","        5. **\"then an example of a good response to that prompt or question in quotation marks\"**\n","        6. then `}`\n","        7. Each example separated by commas within the `train_data = [...]` For example:\n","        ```python\n","        # Make sure the samples are nested in the [] after \"train_data=\"\n","        train_data = [\n","             # First example\n","             { # Start the example with a {\n","                  'input': \"Write something to cheer someone up\", # Don't forget the comma  \n","              'output':\"Don't worry. Be happy!\"\n","              }, # Separate examples with a second comma\n","             # Second example\n","             {'input': \"Tell me something that may make someone nervous\", 'output': \"Did you hear about the storms that may be coming today?\"},\n","             # And a third example:\n","             {'input': \"Say something happy\", 'output': 'The sky is blue and the water is clear and warm. Dive right on in with us!'} # , ... add as many as you can\n","        ]\n","        \n","        ```\n","    6. **For advanced users: (optional to read, optional to understand):** This automatically reformats the simple dictionary of example inputs and outputs into the format: `<bos><beginning_of_turn>user\\n\\n[user's prompt]<end_of_turn>\\n\\n<beginning_of_turn>model\\n\\n[intended chatbot response]<end_of_turn><eos>`.\n","        1. `<bos>` means \"beginning of sample\".\n","        2. `<eos>` means \"end of sample\".\n","        3. `<beginning_of_turn>user\\n\\n` means \"What is started on the next line is an example of a user prompt\"\n","        4. `<beginning_of_turn>model\\n\\n` \"What is started on the next line is an example of a chatbot response\"\n","        4. `<end_of_turn>` means end of `[user prompt | chatbot response]`\n","    7. **For advanced users: (optional to read, optional to understand):**  Note that you can modify this to allow for more complex conversation examples where one example has multiple iterations of `<beginning_of_turn>user\\n\\n[user prompt example]\\n\\n<end_of_turn>\\n\\n<beginning_of_turn>model [example initial response]\\n\\n<end_of_turn>\\n\\n<beginning_of_turn>user\\n\\n [example follow - up prompt or question]\\n\\n<end_of_turn>n\\n<beginning_of_turn>model\\n\\n [example response to the follow - up question]`. If you are going to train on more complex you may need to skip the step that translates the simple `{'input':'foo', \"output\":bar}` dictionaries into the formatted training data and either manually format the data accordingly or modify the code that parses and formats the training samples to accomodate however many iterations of follow - up questions you plan to include.  \n","5. **Model Selection: (Optional, recommended for advanced use cases where the instructions the custom chatbot is handling are complex)** Adjust the `model_name` variable if you want to use a different Gemma-2 model (e.g., \"google/gemma-2-9b-it\", and \"google/gemma-2-27b-it\" are the larger models that perform even better).  Remember that if you want to use a larger model, you will probably need to pay for a paid tier GPU. For most simple tasks, the free tier should work just fine with the default model of \"google/gemma-2-2b-it.\n","6. **Run the Notebook:** Execute the code cells to fine-tune your model once you have customized the training data set.\n","7. **Deployment:** After training, save and commit your LoRA adapter to Hugging Face.  You can then deploy it as a REST API endpoint and integrate it with your preferred chatbot frontend or application."],"metadata":{"id":"r61VC9mgdJBO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["! pip list | grep bitsandbytes"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-Pm1oRAxA7_9","outputId":"a35a9aa9-0f79-412c-ff16-61e507dd8538","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736399077638,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1749,"user":{"displayName":"David Thrower","userId":"01809246225080656148"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["bitsandbytes                       0.45.0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Important:\n","\n","### **If the response for the cell above was blank**, we need to install one more Python package.\n","\n","### If if does not print out something like this, then we need to install bitsandbytes:\n","\n","`bitsandbytes                       0.45.0\n","`\n","- **If and only if** this was blank, see the cell below, and un-comment out the line `! pip install bitsandbytes`.\n","- Run this cell\n","- Then click **\"Runtime\"** -> **Restart runtime**\n","- Then repeat the cell above.

LEXIS 149233  \\n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \\n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Background:\\n\\nOn October 24, 2008, Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed the vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was subsequently assigned to Defendant Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision, stipulating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms. \\n\\nIn the event of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\\n\\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\\n\\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\\n\\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\\n\\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\\n\\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Legal Issues:\\n\\n**I. Standard of Review:**\\nWells Fargo\\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\\n\\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\\n\\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\\n\\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\\n\\n**A. Express Preemption:**\\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \\u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\\n\\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \\u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\\n\\n**B. Field Preemption:**\\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\\n\\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \\n\\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\\n\\n**Breach of Contract:**\\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\\n\\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections.\"},\n","\n","{\"input\": \"Argue a case on behalf of a client who has been adversely impacted by unclear and vague language within a contract.\", \"output\": \"### Case Overview: White v.

LEXIS 149233  \\n**Case Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \\n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Background:\\n\\nIn October 2008, Laneeka White and Timothy Reese bought a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio, financing it through a Retail Installment Sales Contract assigned to Wells Fargo. The contract was subject to federal and Ohio law.\\n\\nAfter the Plaintiffs defaulted in September 2011, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and scheduled a public sale for October 20, 2011, which actually took place on November 3, 2011. The vehicle was sold for $9,600, significantly less than the stated minimum bid of $14,850. After the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, including $1,291.21 in collection fees.\\n\\nWells Fargo filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees but later dismissed it voluntarily. Plaintiffs then filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Legal Issues:\\n\\n**I. Standard of Review:**\\nWells Fargo's motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\\n\\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\\n\\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\\n\\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\\n\\n**A. Express Preemption:**\\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. Defendant cited 12 C.F.R. \\u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\\n\\n**B. Field Preemption:**\\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\\n\\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations.\\n\\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. However, the court determined that this case involved a three-party transaction where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution, making RISA applicable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\\n\\n**Breach of Contract:**\\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\\n\\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections.\"},\n","\n","{\"input\": \"Argue a case on behalf of a client who has been adversely impacted by unclear and vague language within a contract.\", \"output\": \"### Case Summary: White v.

Supp. 2d 756, 78 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (West) 942, 2012 WL 4958516, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149233  \\n**Case Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \\n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Background:\\n\\nIn October 2008, Laneeka White and Timothy Reese bought a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio, financing it through a Retail Installment Sales Contract assigned to Wells Fargo. The contract was subject to federal and Ohio law.\\n\\nAfter the Plaintiffs defaulted in September 2011, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and scheduled a public sale for October 20, 2011, which actually took place on November 3, 2011. The vehicle was sold for $9,600, significantly less than the stated minimum bid of $14,850. After the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, including $1,291.21 in collection fees.\\n\\nWells Fargo filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees but later dismissed it voluntarily. Plaintiffs then filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Legal Issues:\\n\\n**I. Standard of Review:**\\nWells Fargo's motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\\n\\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\\n\\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\\n\\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\\n\\n**A. Express Preemption:**\\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. Defendant cited 12 C.F.R. \\u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\\n\\n**B. Field Preemption:**\\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\\n\\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations.\\n\\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. However, the court determined that this case involved a three-party transaction where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution, making RISA applicable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\\n\\n**Breach of Contract:**\\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\\n\\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections.\"},\n","\n","## # Case 3, Issue 2: White v.

LEXIS 149233  \\n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \\n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Background:\\n\\nOn October 24, 2008, Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed the vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was subsequently assigned to Defendant Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision, stipulating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms. \\n\\nIn the event of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\\n\\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\\n\\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\\n\\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\\n\\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\\n\\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Legal Issues:\\n\\n**I. Standard of Review:**\\nWells Fargo\\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\\n\\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\\n\\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\\n\\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\\n\\n**A. Express Preemption:**\\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \\u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\\n\\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \\u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\\n\\n**B. Field Preemption:**\\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\\n\\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \\n\\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\\n\\n**Breach of Contract:**\\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\\n\\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections.\"},\n","\n","{\"input\": \"Assist me in contesting the additional fees the bank tacked on to my balance.\", \"output\": \"### Case Overview: White v.

Ohio 2012)\\n\\n**Court:** United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio  \\n**Filed:** October 17, 2012  \\n**Precedential Status:** Precedential  \\n**Citation:** 904 F. Supp. 2d 756, 78 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (West) 942, 2012 WL 4958516, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149233  \\n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \\n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Background:\\n\\nOn October 24, 2008, Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed the vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was subsequently assigned to Defendant Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision, stipulating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms. \\n\\nIn the event of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\\n\\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\\n\\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\\n\\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\\n\\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\\n\\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Legal Issues:\\n\\n**I. Standard of Review:**\\nWells Fargo\\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\\n\\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\\n\\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\\n\\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\\n\\n**A. Express Preemption:**\\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \\u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\\n\\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \\u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\\n\\n**B. Field Preemption:**\\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\\n\\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \\n\\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\\n\\n**Breach of Contract:**\\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\\n\\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections.\"},\n","\n","{\"input\": \"Write an answer to a claim that a breach of contract claim should be dismissed.\", \"output\": \"### Case Overview: White and Reese v.

Ohio 2012)\\n\\n**Court:** United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio  \\n**Filed:** October 17, 2012  \\n**Precedential Status:** Precedential  \\n**Citation:** 904 F. Supp. 2d 756, 78 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (West) 942, 2012 WL 4958516, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149233  \\n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \\n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Background:\\n\\nOn October 24, 2008, Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed the vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was subsequently assigned to Defendant Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision, stipulating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms. \\n\\nIn the event of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\\n\\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\\n\\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\\n\\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\\n\\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\\n\\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Legal Issues:\\n\\n**I. Standard of Review:**\\nWells Fargo\\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\\n\\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\\n\\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\\n\\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\\n\\n**A. Express Preemption:**\\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \\u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\\n\\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \\u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\\n\\n**B. Field Preemption:**\\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\\n\\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \\n\\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\\n\\n**Breach of Contract:**\\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\\n\\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject.

Frazier\\n\\n#### Background\\n\\nPlaintiffs Franz Lesti and Petra Richter filed a Motion to Compel Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to produce information regarding Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs, a co-conspirator. The Plaintiffs sought this information in relation to their claims involving alleged financial misconduct. The case revolves around the claim that Wells Fargo facilitated illicit transactions by allowing Fuchs to transfer money from accounts associated with her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts after allegedly discovering suspicious activity.\\n\\n#### Key Facts\\n\\n1. **Plaintiffs' Request:** The Plaintiffs requested all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, emphasizing the need to understand Wells Fargo's conduct in opening accounts for her, particularly in light of accusations of money laundering.\\n\\n2. **Defendant's Response:** Wells Fargo objected to the request, citing several reasons:\\n   - The request was overly broad and burdensome.\\n   - The documents were irrelevant to the case and not likely to lead to admissible evidence.\\n   - Assertions of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were made.\\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were routine and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\\n\\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo claimed that certain documents were protected under the SAR privilege, which prevents the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court noted that supporting documentation generated in the ordinary course of business is discoverable.\\n\\n#### Court's Findings\\n\\n- The Court ruled that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were relevant and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It limited the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while protecting the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\\n- The Court required Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\\u2019 accounts while not obligating them to disclose privileged communications.\\n\\n#### Orders\\n\\n1. The Motion to Compel was **GRANTED IN PART** and **DENIED IN PART**:\\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\\n\\n2. The Court declined to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\\n\\n#### Legal Principles\\n\\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court emphasized that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The burden of proving a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court distinguished between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\\n\\nThis ruling underscores the broad scope of discovery in civil litigation while balancing the need for confidentiality in banking operations.\"},\n","\n","{\"input\": \"Present a case disputing the bank's decision to withhold information and avoid answering inquiries.\", \"output\": \"### Overview of *Lesti v.

The lawsuit centers around the allegation that Wells Fargo enabled unlawful transactions by permitting Fuchs to move funds from accounts associated with her business, PCOM, to her personal accounts, even after allegedly detecting suspicious activity.\\n\\n#### Significant Facts\\n\\n1. **Plaintiffs' Petition:** The Plaintiffs sought all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, highlighting the necessity to comprehend Wells Fargo's actions in establishing accounts for her, especially in the context of money laundering allegations.\\n\\n2. **Defendant's Position:** Wells Fargo opposed the request, citing several reasons:\\n   - The request was excessively broad and onerous.\\n   - The documents were not pertinent to the case and unlikely to lead to admissible evidence.\\n   - Claims of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were raised.\\n   - The bank argued that the accounts under scrutiny were standard and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\\n\\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo asserted that certain documents were safeguarded under the SAR privilege, which prohibits the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court pointed out that supporting documentation created in the normal course of business is discoverable.\\n\\n#### Court's Decisions\\n\\n- The Court determined that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were pertinent and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It narrowed the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while preserving the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\\n- The Court mandated Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\\u2019 accounts while not compelling them to disclose privileged communications.\\n\\n#### Court Orders\\n\\n1. The Motion to Compel was **PARTIALLY GRANTED** and **PARTIALLY DENIED**:\\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\\n\\n2. The Court chose not to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\\n\\n#### Applicable Law\\n\\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court stressed that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The responsibility of demonstrating a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents such as *Union Bank of California v.

The case revolves around the claim that Wells Fargo facilitated illicit transactions by allowing Fuchs to transfer money from accounts associated with her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts after allegedly discovering suspicious activity.\\n\\n#### Key Facts\\n\\n1. **Plaintiffs' Request:** The Plaintiffs requested all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, emphasizing the need to understand Wells Fargo's conduct in opening accounts for her, particularly in light of accusations of money laundering.\\n\\n2. **Defendant's Response:** Wells Fargo objected to the request, citing several reasons:\\n   - The request was overly broad and burdensome.\\n   - The documents were irrelevant to the case and not likely to lead to admissible evidence.\\n   - Assertions of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were made.\\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were routine and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\\n\\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo claimed that certain documents were protected under the SAR privilege, which prevents the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court noted that supporting documentation generated in the ordinary course of business is discoverable.\\n\\n#### Court's Findings\\n\\n- The Court ruled that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were relevant and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It limited the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while protecting the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\\n- The Court required Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\\u2019 accounts while not obligating them to disclose privileged communications.\\n\\n#### Orders\\n\\n1. The Motion to Compel was **GRANTED IN PART** and **DENIED IN PART**:\\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\\n\\n2. The Court declined to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\\n\\n#### Legal Principles\\n\\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court emphasized that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The burden of proving a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court distinguished between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\\n\\nThis ruling underscores the broad scope of discovery in civil litigation while balancing the need for confidentiality in banking operations.\"},\n","\n","{\"input\": \"The bank is claiming attorney cleint privelage to avoid answering my quesions and producing the documents I need.

However, the Court took note that supporting documentation created in the normal course of business is discoverable.\\n\\n#### Court's Conclusions\\n\\n- The Court determined that the documents pertaining to Fuchs' accounts were pertinent and could lead to the uncovering of admissible evidence. It restricted the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while safeguarding the SAR privilege concerning drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\\n- The Court mandated Wells Fargo to furnish business records pertaining to Fuchs\\u2019 accounts while not compelling them to reveal privileged communications.\\n\\n#### Directives\\n\\n1. The Motion to Compel was **PARTIALLY GRANTED** and **PARTIALLY DENIED**:\\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was directed to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had secured a waiver after the depositions.\\n\\n2. The Court refrained from imposing any penalties or costs on the Plaintiffs.\\n\\n#### Legal Doctrines\\n\\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court underscored that relevant information is discoverable, even if it is not directly admissible in court. The onus of demonstrating a lack of relevance rests with the party resisting the discovery.\\n- **SAR Privilege**: In line with precedents such as *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v.

Bailey, the Debtor, initiated an adversary proceeding against Wells Fargo Bank, NA, seeking to invalidate a foreclosure on her property, claiming that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage at the time of the foreclosure sale. The case arose following Bailey's Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing on November 9, 2009, after Wells Fargo conducted a foreclosure sale on October 23, 2009.\\n\\n#### Relevant Case Facts\\n\\n1. **Mortgage Origin**: In 1992, Bailey obtained a $104,000 mortgage from Shawmut Mortgage Company for her property in Hudson, Massachusetts.  \\n2. **Foreclosure Actions**: After Bailey defaulted on her mortgage payments in late 2008, Wells Fargo filed a petition to foreclose on the property, claiming to be the mortgage holder.  \\n3. **Foreclosure Sale**: The property was sold to a third party during the foreclosure process.  \\n4. **Adversary Proceeding**: Bailey filed an adversary complaint against Wells Fargo on November 23, 2009, claiming the foreclosure was invalid due to Wells Fargo\\u2019s lack of holder status.\\n\\n#### Claims in the Complaint\\n\\nBailey\\u2019s five-count complaint included:\\n\\n1. **Count I**: Declaratory Judgment - Bailey sought to declare the foreclosure invalid based on Wells Fargo's failure to prove it was the mortgage holder.\\n2. **Count II**: Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing - Alleging Wells Fargo acted carelessly regarding the custody of mortgage documents.\\n3. **Count III**: Infliction of Emotional Distress - Claiming Wells Fargo's actions caused her extreme emotional distress.\\n4. **Count IV**: Unjust Enrichment - Arguing that Wells Fargo was unjustly enriched by accepting payments without holding the mortgage.\\n5. **Count V**: Violations of Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute (G.L. c. 93A) - Claiming Wells Fargo engaged in unfair and deceptive practices.\\n\\n#### Positions of the Parties\\n\\n- **Debtor\\u2019s Argument**: Bailey contended that because there was no recorded transfer of the mortgage from Shawmut to Washington Mutual (the entity that assigned the mortgage to Wells Fargo), the foreclosure was invalid. She relied on precedents like *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v. Ibanez* and *In re Schwartz* to support her claims.\\n  \\n- **Defendant\\u2019s Argument**: Wells Fargo argued that the mortgage was validly transferred through off-record mergers and that recording is not a strict requirement under Massachusetts law. They asserted that they held the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, citing a chain of title.\\n\\n#### Court\\u2019s Analysis\\n\\n1. **Motion to Dismiss Standard**: The court applied the standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), emphasizing that allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true, and reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\\n\\n2. **Count I: Declaratory Judgment**: The court found Bailey adequately alleged that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, thus denying the motion to dismiss this count. The court distinguished the requirements of holder status from perfect record title, affirming that the absence of a clear chain of title could invalidate the foreclosure.\\n\\n3. **Count II: Breach of Implied Covenant**: The court granted the motion to dismiss this count, reasoning that if Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage, there was no contract to breach. Additionally, no bad faith or unethical conduct was sufficiently alleged.\\n\\n4. **Count III: Infliction of Emotional Distress**: The court dismissed this count, stating that Bailey failed to establish extreme and outrageous conduct by Wells Fargo necessary for intentional infliction claims. Negligent infliction claims failed due to the lack of physical harm.\\n\\n5. **Count IV: Unjust Enrichment**: The court dismissed this count on the grounds that Bailey would be unjustly enriched if any payments to Wells Fargo were returned, as she was obligated to pay someone under the mortgage.\\n\\n6. **Count V: Chapter 93A**: The court dismissed this count, finding no factual basis to support claims of unfair or deceptive practices by Wells Fargo.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nThe court denied Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss for Count I (declaratory judgment) but granted it for Counts II through V. Thus, the case centered on whether Wells Fargo had the legitimate authority to foreclose, raising significant issues about mortgage holder status and the implications of Massachusetts foreclosure law.\\n\\n### Key Case Law and Authorities Cited\\n\\n- *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v.

Boroff\\n\\n#### Case Background\\n\\nCarmen M. Bailey, the plaintiff, initiated a legal dispute against Wells Fargo Bank, NA, challenging the validity of a foreclosure on her property. Bailey alleged that Wells Fargo was not the rightful mortgage holder during the foreclosure sale. The case emerged following Bailey's Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing on November 9, 2009, subsequent to Wells Fargo's foreclosure sale on October 23, 2009.\\n\\n#### Pertinent Case Facts\\n\\n1. **Mortgage Origination**: Bailey acquired a $104,000 mortgage from Shawmut Mortgage Company in 1992 for her property in Hudson, Massachusetts.  \\n2. **Foreclosure Initiation**: Wells Fargo commenced foreclosure proceedings on Bailey's property after she defaulted on her mortgage payments in late 2008.  \\n3. **Foreclosure Completion**: The property was sold to a third party during the foreclosure process.  \\n4. **Adversary Proceeding**: Bailey filed a complaint against Wells Fargo on November 23, 2009, asserting that the foreclosure was invalid due to Wells Fargo's lack of mortgage holder status.\\n\\n#### Complaint Allegations\\n\\nBailey's complaint consisted of five counts:\\n\\n1. **Count I**: Declaratory Judgment - Bailey sought a declaration that the foreclosure was invalid due to Wells Fargo's inability to prove it was the mortgage holder.\\n2. **Count II**: Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing - Alleging that Wells Fargo mishandled the custody of mortgage documents.\\n3. **Count III**: Infliction of Emotional Distress - Claiming that Wells Fargo's actions caused her severe emotional distress.\\n4. **Count IV**: Unjust Enrichment - Arguing that Wells Fargo was unjustly enriched by accepting payments without holding the mortgage.\\n5. **Count V**: Violations of Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute (G.L. c. 93A) - Claiming that Wells Fargo engaged in unethical and misleading practices.\\n\\n#### Parties' Positions\\n\\n- **Plaintiff's Argument**: Bailey argued that the foreclosure was invalid because there was no recorded transfer of the mortgage from Shawmut to Washington Mutual (the entity that assigned the mortgage to Wells Fargo). She relied on precedents like *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v. Ibanez* and *In re Schwartz* to support her claims.\\n  \\n- **Defendant\\u2019s Argument**: Wells Fargo contended that the mortgage was validly transferred through unrecorded mergers and that recording is not a strict requirement under Massachusetts law. They asserted that they held the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, citing a chain of title.\\n\\n#### Court's Ruling\\n\\n1. **Motion to Dismiss Standard**: The court applied the standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), emphasizing that allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true, and reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\\n\\n2. **Count I: Declaratory Judgment**: The court found that Bailey adequately alleged that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, thus denying the motion to dismiss this count. The court distinguished the requirements of holder status from perfect record title, affirming that the absence of a clear chain of title could invalidate the foreclosure.\\n\\n3. **Count II: Breach of Implied Covenant**: The court granted the motion to dismiss this count, reasoning that if Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage, there was no contract to breach. Additionally, no bad faith or unethical conduct was sufficiently alleged.\\n\\n4. **Count III: Infliction of Emotional Distress**: The court dismissed this count, stating that Bailey failed to establish extreme and outrageous conduct by Wells Fargo necessary for intentional infliction claims. Negligent infliction claims failed due to the lack of physical harm.\\n\\n5. **Count IV: Unjust Enrichment**: The court dismissed this count on the grounds that Bailey would be unjustly enriched if any payments to Wells Fargo were returned, as she was obligated to pay someone under the mortgage.\\n\\n6. **Count V: Chapter 93A**: The court dismissed this count, finding no factual basis to support claims of unfair or deceptive practices by Wells Fargo.\\n\\n#### Final Outcome\\n\\nThe court denied Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss for Count I (declaratory judgment) but granted it for Counts II through V. Thus, the case focused on whether Wells Fargo had the legitimate authority to foreclose, raising significant issues about mortgage holder status and the implications of Massachusetts foreclosure law.\\n\\n### Significant Case Law and Authorities Cited\\n\\n- *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v.

Blake had previously signed a promissory note and mortgage with Century Mortgage Company as the lender and APR Mortgage Corporation as the broker on December 1, 2009.\\n\\n#### Claims Against Wells Fargo\\n\\nThough the primary defendants were Century, Landstar Title, and Prominent Title, Wells Fargo was involved due to its position as the current holder of the note and mortgage:\\n\\n1. **Prohibited Kickbacks**: Blake asserted that Century, APR, Landstar, and Prominent had an affiliated relationship resulting in unlawful kickbacks, violating **12 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2607(a)**, which forbids such practices in federally related mortgage loans.\\n\\n2. **Truth in Lending Act (TILA) Breaches**: Blake argued that the unlawful kickbacks should have been incorporated into the finance charge calculation for his mortgage loan, infringing upon the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1601 et seq.) and Regulation Z (15 C.F.R. pt. 226).\\n\\n3. **Fifth Claim - Civil Aiding and Abetting**: Blake alleged that Century, Landstar, and Prominent were civilly liable for facilitating APR\\u2019s unlawful conduct related to the mortgage transaction. He maintained that they were aware of the illegal kickbacks and shared in the profits, making them jointly responsible.\\n\\n#### Motions to Dismiss\\n\\n- **Wells Fargo's Motion**: The text does not specify Wells Fargo's exact arguments, but it indicates that Wells Fargo sought dismissal of Blake's claims, likely disputing the accuracy of the allegations based on its role as the mortgage holder.\\n\\n- **Other Defendants' Motions**: Century, Landstar, and Prominent filed motions asserting that Ohio law does not acknowledge a claim for civil aiding and abetting. They argued that Blake had failed to establish a valid claim as a matter of law.\\n\\n#### Court's Evaluation\\n\\n1. **Civil Aiding and Abetting**: The court reviewed the legal standards for civil aiding and abetting claims under Ohio law, referencing the **Restatement (Second) of Torts, \\u00a7 876**, which outlines the requirements for such claims.\\n\\n2. **Pivotal Case Law**:\\n   - **Aetna Cas. & Sur.

Consequently, the court granted the motions to dismiss from Century, Landstar, and Prominent, effectively removing them from the lawsuit.\\n\\n#### Final Ruling\\n\\nThe court ordered the dismissal of Century Mortgage Company, Landstar Title, LLC, and Prominent Title Agency, LLC from the case, leaving Wells Fargo as the remaining defendant due to its role as the mortgage holder.\\n\\n### Significant References Cited\\n\\n- **12 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2607(a)**: Prohibits kickbacks in real estate settlement services.\\n- **Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1601 et seq.)**: Governs disclosures related to the finance charges on loans.\\n- **Restatement (Second) of Torts, \\u00a7 876**: Details conditions for liability in aiding and abetting tortious conduct.\\n- **Aetna Cas. & Sur.

Blake filed a complaint on May 30, 2012, against multiple defendants, including Wells Fargo Bank, NA, associated with a mortgage transaction for his principal dwelling in Westerville, Ohio. Blake executed a promissory note and mortgage on December 1, 2009, with Century Mortgage Company as the lender and APR Mortgage Corporation as the broker.\\n\\n#### Allegations Against Wells Fargo\\n\\nAlthough the primary focus of the complaint was on Century, Landstar Title, and Prominent Title, Wells Fargo was implicated due to its status as the current holder of the note and mortgage:\\n\\n1. **Illegal Kickbacks**: Blake alleged that Century, APR, Landstar, and Prominent were engaged in an affiliate relationship that resulted in illegal kickbacks in violation of **12 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2607(a)**, which prohibits such practices in federally related mortgage loans.\\n\\n2. **Truth in Lending Act (TILA) Violations**: Blake claimed that the illegal kickbacks should have been included in the calculation of the finance charge for his mortgage loan, which violated the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1601 et seq.) and Regulation Z (15 C.F.R. pt. 226).\\n\\n3. **Fifth Count - Civil Aiding and Abetting**: Blake alleged that Century, Landstar, and Prominent had civil liability for aiding and abetting APR\\u2019s unlawful conduct related to the mortgage transaction.

They contended that Blake failed to state a valid claim as a matter of law.\\n\\n#### Court's Analysis\\n\\n1. **Civil Aiding and Abetting**: The court reviewed the legal standards for civil aiding and abetting claims under Ohio law, referencing the **Restatement (Second) of Torts, \\u00a7 876**, which outlines the requirements for such claims.\\n\\n2. **Key Case Law**:\\n   - **Aetna Cas. & Sur.

They alleged that while these negotiations were ongoing, WFB initiated foreclosure proceedings against their home.\\n\\n2. **Claims of Dual Tracking**: The plaintiffs accused WFB of engaging in dual tracking, which is the practice of pursuing foreclosure while simultaneously reviewing a loan modification application. This practice is prohibited under California law.\\n\\n3. **Lack of Communication**: They claimed WFB failed to provide a single point of contact, contrary to the requirements of California law, resulting in them being transferred among different representatives.\\n\\n4. **Notice of Trustee\\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing negotiations.\\n\\n#### Removal to Federal Court\\n\\nWFB removed the case to federal court, asserting diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1332, claiming that:\\n- Plaintiffs are citizens of California.\\n- WFB is a citizen of South Dakota.\\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a citizen of multiple states including Delaware and Texas.\\n\\n#### Legal Standards\\n\\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1332, federal courts have jurisdiction over civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the parties are citizens of different states.

As a result, the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\\n\\n2. **Remand to State Court**: The court ordered the case remanded to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1447(c).\\n\\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions were denied as moot due to the remand.\\n\\n### Summary of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights\\n\\nThe California Homeowner Bill of Rights became law on January 1, 2013, with many provisions renewed and modified as of January 1, 2019. It aims to protect homeowners facing foreclosure, particularly with respect to dual tracking and loan modifications.\\n\\n#### Key Provisions\\n\\n1. **Notification of Foreclosure-Prevention Options**: Servicers must contact homeowners at least 30 days before starting foreclosure to discuss options. They must also provide information regarding alternatives to avoid foreclosure after recording a notice of default.\\n\\n2. **Guaranteed Single Point of Contact**: Homeowners must be assigned a specific representative to guide them through the loan modification process.\\n\\n3. **Acknowledgment of Application**: Servicers must notify homeowners of any missing information or errors in their loan modification applications within five business days.\\n\\n4. **Restrictions on Fees**: Homeowners cannot be charged fees for applying for a loan modification and cannot incur late fees while the servicer is reviewing their application.\\n\\n5. **Restrictions on Dual Tracking**: The foreclosure process must be paused while a loan modification application is under review, and foreclosure cannot proceed while homeowners comply with an approved modification plan.\\n\\n6. **Denial Rights**: If a loan modification is denied, the servicer must provide written reasons and allow homeowners to appeal the decision.\\n\\n7. **Transfer Rights**: If a loan modification is approved and the loan is sold or transferred, the new servicer must honor the existing modification.\\n\\n8. **Verification of Documents**: Servicers must ensure that foreclosure documents are accurate and supported by reliable evidence.\\n\\n9. **Tenant Rights**: Purchasers of foreclosed homes must provide tenants with at least 90 days before starting eviction proceedings and must honor existing leases in certain circumstances.\\n\\n#### Application and Enforcement\\n\\nThe Homeowner Bill of Rights applies to first-lien mortgages on owner-occupied homes with no more than four units. Homeowners who believe their rights have been violated may seek legal assistance and report violations to relevant state authorities.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe court's ruling in *Garcia v.

The lawsuit was initially filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court and subsequently transferred to federal court by WFB based on diversity jurisdiction.\\n\\n#### Background Facts\\n\\n1. **Loan Modification Talks**: The Garcias were in discussions with WFB to secure a modification of their home loan for their property at 17129 Leal Ave., Cerritos, California. They claimed that WFB initiated foreclosure proceedings while these discussions were ongoing.\\n\\n2. **Allegations of Dual Tracking**: The Garcias alleged that WFB's actions amounted to 'dual tracking,' a practice where a lender pursues foreclosure while simultaneously considering a loan modification application. This practice is prohibited under **Cal. Civ. Code \\u00a7 2924.12**.\\n\\n3. **Lack of Clear Communication**: The Garcias indicated that WFB did not provide a single point of contact as required by **Cal. Civ. Code \\u00a7 2923.7**, causing them to be transferred between different representatives. They also claimed that WFB repeatedly asked for documents they had already submitted.\\n\\n4. **Notice of Trustee\\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing loan modification negotiations.\\n\\n#### Transfer to Federal Court\\n\\nWFB moved the case to federal court, asserting diversity jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1332**.

Garcia, the plaintiffs, filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (WFB) and other defendants, alleging they violated the California Homeowner Bill of Rights, specifically regarding 'dual tracking' of their mortgage. The case was initially filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court and subsequently moved to federal court by WFB, based on diversity jurisdiction.\\n\\n#### Background Information\\n\\n1. **Loan Modification Discussions**: The plaintiffs were in talks with WFB to modify their home loan for their property at 17129 Leal Ave., Cerritos, California. They claimed that WFB initiated foreclosure proceedings while these discussions were ongoing.\\n\\n2. **Allegations of Dual Tracking**: The plaintiffs alleged that WFB's actions constituted 'dual tracking,' which involves a lender pursuing foreclosure while considering a loan modification application. This practice is prohibited under **Cal. Civ. Code \\u00a7 2924.12**.\\n\\n3. **Lack of Communication**: The plaintiffs stated that WFB did not provide a single point of contact as required by **Cal. Civ. Code \\u00a7 2923.7**, resulting in them being transferred between representatives. They also claimed that WFB repeatedly requested documents that they had already submitted.\\n\\n4. **Notice of Trustee\\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing negotiations for loan modification.\\n\\n#### Transfer to Federal Court\\n\\nWFB transferred the case to federal court, claiming diversity jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1332**. WFB stated:\\n- The plaintiffs are residents of California.\\n- WFB is a resident of South Dakota.\\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a resident of Delaware, Texas, Michigan, and Minnesota.\\n\\n#### Legal Principles\\n\\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under **28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1332**, federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions where the matter in dispute exceeds $75,000 and the parties are residents of different states. The removal statute is strictly interpreted against removal jurisdiction.\\n\\n2. **Corporate Residency**: A corporation is considered a resident of the state of incorporation and the state where its principal place of business is located. For national banks, **28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1348** states that they are residents of the states in which they are 'located.'\\n\\n#### Jurisdictional Review\\n\\n1. **National Banking Association**: WFB, as a national bank, is subject to a different jurisdictional provision. The court noted that WFB is a resident of the state where its main office is located, as established in its articles of incorporation.\\n\\n2. **Interpretations of 'Located'**: The term 'located' for national banks has been interpreted in various ways by courts:\\n   - Where the bank has its main office.\\n   - Where it has branches.\\n   - Where its principal place of business is.\\n\\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**:\\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt*, the Supreme Court ruled that a national bank is a resident of the state where its main office is located. The Court did not resolve whether a bank could also be a resident of the state where its principal place of business is located.\\n   - Courts have generally recognized both definitions, leading to varying interpretations across circuits.\\n\\n#### Court's Ruling\\n\\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Not Available**: The court determined that WFB is a resident of both California and South Dakota. Since the plaintiffs are California residents, there is no complete diversity, and thus, the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\\n\\n2. **Return to State Court**: The court ordered the case returned to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1447(c)**.\\n\\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions related to the case were denied as moot given the return to state court.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nThe court concluded that Wells Fargo's residency, as a national bank, included both its main office and its principal place of business, resulting in a lack of complete diversity. Consequently, the case was returned to state court, affirming the strong presumption against removal jurisdiction.\\n\\n### Key Authorities Referenced\\n\\n- **Cal. Civ.

Garcia filed a complaint against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (WFB) and other defendants, alleging violations related to the California Homeowner Bill of Rights, specifically regarding 'dual tracking' of their mortgage. The case was originally filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and was subsequently removed to federal court by WFB based on diversity jurisdiction.\\n\\n#### Background Facts\\n\\n1. **Loan Modification Negotiations**: The plaintiffs were engaged in negotiations with WFB to obtain a modification of their home loan for property located at 17129 Leal Ave., Cerritos, California. They claimed that while these negotiations were ongoing, WFB initiated foreclosure proceedings against their property.\\n\\n2. **Claims of Dual Tracking**: The plaintiffs alleged that WFB's actions constituted 'dual tracking,' which occurs when a lender pursues foreclosure while simultaneously considering a loan modification application. This practice is prohibited under **Cal. Civ. Code \\u00a7 2924.12**.\\n\\n3. **Lack of Communication**: The plaintiffs indicated that WFB failed to provide a single point of contact as required by **Cal. Civ. Code \\u00a7 2923.7**, resulting in them being shuffled between representatives. They also claimed that WFB repeatedly requested documentation that they had already submitted.\\n\\n4. **Notice of Trustee\\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing negotiations for loan modification.\\n\\n#### Removal to Federal Court\\n\\nWFB removed the case to federal court, asserting diversity jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1332**. WFB claimed:\\n- The plaintiffs are citizens of California.\\n- WFB is a citizen of South Dakota.\\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a citizen of Delaware, Texas, Michigan, and Minnesota.\\n\\n#### Legal Standards\\n\\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under **28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1332**, federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the parties are citizens of different states. The removal statute is strictly construed against removal jurisdiction.\\n\\n2. **Corporate Citizenship**: A corporation is deemed a citizen of the state of incorporation and the state where its principal place of business is located. For national banks, **28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1348** provides that they are citizens of the states in which they are 'located.'\\n\\n#### Jurisdictional Analysis\\n\\n1. **National Banking Association**: WFB, as a national bank, is governed by a different jurisdictional provision. The court noted that WFB is a citizen of the state where its main office is located, as established in its articles of incorporation.\\n\\n2. **Definitions of 'Located'**: The term 'located' for national banks has been interpreted in various ways by courts:\\n   - Where the bank has its main office.\\n   - Where it has branches.\\n   - Where its principal place of business is.\\n\\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**:\\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt*, the Supreme Court held that a national bank is a citizen of the state where its main office is located. The Court did not resolve whether a bank could also be a citizen of the state where its principal place of business is located.\\n   - Courts have generally recognized both definitions, leading to varying interpretations across circuits.\\n\\n#### Court's Decision\\n\\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Unavailable**: The court found that WFB is a citizen of both California and South Dakota. Since the plaintiffs are California citizens, there is no complete diversity, and thus, the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\\n\\n2. **Remand to State Court**: The court ordered the case remanded to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1447(c)**.\\n\\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions related to the case were denied as moot given the remand.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nThe court concluded that Wells Fargo's citizenship, as a national bank, included both its main office and its principal place of business, resulting in a lack of complete diversity.

Garcia v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA*, 889 F.3d 1230 (11th Cir. 2018)\\n\\n**Court:** United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit  \\n**Filed:** May 10, 2018  \\n**Citation:** 889 F.3d 1230  \\n**Docket Numbers:** 16-16820; 16-16823  \\n**Judges:** Tjoflat, Jordan, Steele  \\n**Author:** Tjoflat  \\n\\n#### Nature of the Suit\\n\\nThis case arises from five class actions filed by customers of Wells Fargo Bank, alleging unlawful overdraft fees. The central issue on appeal was whether Wells Fargo waived its right to compel arbitration for unnamed class members.\\n\\n#### Case Facts\\n\\n1. **Background of the Actions**: \\n   - Plaintiffs, including Dolores Gutierrez, Marc Martinez, and Melanie L. Garcia, are current or former checking account holders of Wells Fargo or Wachovia Bank.\\n   - The allegations focus on improper overdraft fees charged by Wells Fargo. \\n\\n2. **Consolidation of Cases**: \\n   - In June 2009, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated these cases with others against banks accused of similar practices.\\n\\n3. **Arbitration Agreements**: \\n   - Wells Fargo\\u2019s customer agreements included clauses for arbitration of disputes on an individual basis, explicitly prohibiting class actions.\\n   - The agreements stated that either party could compel arbitration 'at any reasonable time' notwithstanding any ongoing litigation.\\n\\n4. **Wells Fargo's Actions**:\\n   - After the consolidation, Wells Fargo did not move to compel arbitration for the named plaintiffs but instead joined an omnibus motion to dismiss.\\n   - In April 2010, after observing that few defendants had moved to compel arbitration, the District Court ordered defendants intending to seek arbitration to do so by April 19, 2010. Wells Fargo responded that it would not seek arbitration against the named plaintiffs but reserved its rights against unnamed future plaintiffs.\\n\\n5. **Concepcion Decision**: \\n   - Following the Supreme Court's decision in *AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion* (2011), which upheld the enforceability of arbitration agreements barring class actions, Wells Fargo reconsidered its strategy and moved to compel arbitration against the named plaintiffs. The District Court denied this motion, finding Wells Fargo waived its arbitration rights.\\n\\n6. **Subsequent Proceedings**:\\n   - The named plaintiffs sought class certification, while Wells Fargo filed conditional motions to compel arbitration against unnamed class members if the class was certified. The District Court denied these motions, leading to the appeal.\\n\\n#### Court's Analysis\\n\\n1. **Standard of Review**: \\n   - The Court reviewed the denial of the motion to compel arbitration de novo and recognized that arbitration rights can be waived, but federal law strongly favors arbitration.\\n\\n2. **Waiver of Arbitration Rights**: \\n   - The Court conducted a two-part inquiry to assess waiver: (1) whether Wells Fargo acted inconsistently with its arbitration rights and (2) whether such conduct prejudiced the plaintiffs.\\n   - The Court noted that Wells Fargo had not acted inconsistently regarding unnamed plaintiffs as it had reserved its arbitration rights explicitly.\\n\\n3. **Judicial Precedents Cited**:\\n   - **Benoay v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc.**, 805 F.2d 1437 (11th Cir. 1986): Established that the right to arbitrate can be waived.\\n   - **Stone v. E.F. Hutton & Co.**, 898 F.2d 1542 (11th Cir. 1990): Emphasized the heavy burden of proof on the party claiming waiver.\\n   - **Ivax Corp. v. B. Braun of Am., Inc.**, 286 F.3d 1309 (11th Cir. 2002): Discussed the inconsistency standard for waiver.\\n   - **S & H Contractors v. A.J. Taft Coal Co., Inc.**, 906 F.2d 1507 (11th Cir. 1990): Outlined considerations of prejudice regarding arbitration rights.\\n\\n4. **Final Determinations**: \\n   - The Court found that Wells Fargo had not acted inconsistently with its arbitration rights concerning unnamed class members. The District Court's reliance on Wells Fargo's failure to move to compel arbitration before the class was certified was deemed inappropriate due to the speculative nature of the unnamed plaintiffs at that stage.\\n   - The Court concluded that the District Court\\u2019s order was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nThe Eleventh Circuit vacated the District Court's order denying Wells Fargo's motion to compel arbitration concerning unnamed class members, determining that Wells Fargo did not waive its arbitration rights. The ruling emphasizes the need for clarity regarding arbitration rights in class action contexts and the importance of timely invoking those rights without inconsistent actions.\\n\\n### Key Authorities Cited\\n\\n- **AT&T Mobility LLC v.

(national banking association)\\n\\n**Nature of the Suit:** Midland Mortgage filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo for damages, alleging state law claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation.\\n\\n#### Key Issues\\n\\n1. **Duty of Care:** Did Wells Fargo have a duty of care towards Midland Mortgage regarding the Verification of Deposit (VOD)?\\n2. **Breach of Duty:** Did Wells Fargo breach this duty by providing inaccurate VOD information?\\n3. **Proximate Cause:** Was Wells Fargo's breach the direct cause of Midland Mortgage's losses?\\n4. **Reasonable Reliance:** Did Midland Mortgage reasonably rely on the VOD provided by Wells Fargo?\\n5. **Economic Loss Rule:** Does the economic loss rule prevent Midland Mortgage from claiming negligence and negligent misrepresentation?\\n\\n#### Case Background\\n\\n1. **Loan Agreement:** Midland Mortgage agreed to lend money to Brian and Teri Sumsion for a property purchase, requiring a VOD from Wells Fargo to confirm sufficient funds for closing costs.\\n2. **VOD Issuance:** Midland paid $20 for the VOD, which showed a balance of $1,578.51 in the Sumsions' account as of February 14, 2008. The loan closed on February 25, 2008.\\n3. **Insurance Coverage Rescinded:** JP Morgan Chase informed Midland that the mortgage insurer, Republic Mortgage Insurance Company (RMIC), had rescinded coverage due to misrepresented financial information.\\n4. **VOD Reverification:** A second VOD was requested, and Wells Fargo confirmed the original VOD was correct, despite subsequent findings indicating the actual balance was $0.\\n5. **Repurchase Demand:** Midland had to repurchase the loan from Chase due to the rescinded insurance and inaccurate VOD, costing approximately $99,256.00.\\n\\n#### Court Proceedings\\n\\n- **Defendant's Motions:** Wells Fargo filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.\\n- **Plaintiff's Response:** Midland opposed both motions with supporting arguments and evidence.\\n\\n#### Legal Standards Applied\\n\\n1. **Summary Judgment Standard:** Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, a motion for summary judgment is granted if no genuine dispute of material fact exists.\\n   - **Key Cases:** \\n     - *Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.*, 477 U.S. 242 (1986)\\n     - *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*, 477 U.S. 317 (1986)\\n     - *Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc.*, 53 F.3d 55 (4th Cir. 1995)\\n\\n2. **Dismissal Standard:** For a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the court must accept well-pleaded allegations as true and determine if the complaint states a plausible claim.\\n   - **Key Cases:** \\n     - *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)\\n     - *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)\\n\\n3. **Negligence Standards:** To prove negligence in South Carolina, a plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, and damages.\\n   - **Key Cases:** \\n     - *Dorrell v. S.C. Dep't of Transp.*, 361 S.C. 312 (2004)\\n     - *Snow v. City of Columbia*, 305 S.C. 544 (1991)\\n\\n4. **Negligent Misrepresentation:** A claimant must show a false representation, a pecuniary interest, a duty of care, breach, justifiable reliance, and resulting damages.\\n   - **Key Cases:** \\n     - *AMA Mgmt. Corp. v. Strasburger*, 309 S.C. 213 (1992)\\n     - *Winburn v. Ins. Co. of N.Am.*, 287 S.C. 435 (1985)\\n\\n5. **Economic Loss Rule:** The rule limits recovery for economic losses to contract remedies.\\n   - **Key Cases:** \\n     - *Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber and Mfg. Co.*, 299 S.C. 335 (1989)\\n     - *Eaton Corp. v. Trane Carolina Plains*, 350 F.Supp.2d 699 (D.S.C. 2004)\\n\\n#### Court's Rulings\\n\\n1. **No Duty of Care:** The court determined that Wells Fargo did not owe a duty of care to Midland Mortgage concerning the VOD, as the relationship did not indicate a special duty due to the arm's length nature of the transaction.\\n\\n2. **Breach of Duty:** Even if a duty existed, there was insufficient evidence of a breach, as Midland's claims relied on unsupported statements rather than factual evidence.\\n\\n3. **Proximate Causation:** The court found that the inaccurate VOD was not the proximate cause of Midland's injuries, which stemmed from the Borrowers\\u2019 failure to repay the loan, not from the VOD itself.\\n\\n4. **Reasonable Reliance:** The court concluded that Midland could not reasonably rely on the VOD due to disclaimers contained within the document and the absence of a fiduciary relationship.\\n\\n5. **Economic Loss Rule:** The court did not need to address this issue since it had already ruled in favor of Wells Fargo on the negligence claims.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nThe court granted Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment concerning Midland Mortgage's claims of negligence and negligent misrepresentation, finding no duty of care existed and that Midland failed to establish breach, causation, or reasonable reliance. The motion to dismiss was denied as moot.\\n\\n#### Relevant Authorities Cited\\n\\n- **Federal Rules of Civil Procedure**: Rule 12(b)(6), Rule 56\\n- **Case Law**:\\n  - *Anderson v.

America Online Inc., 208 F.3d 741 (9th Cir. 2000) does not preclude private actions under RICO. In fact, the case itself involved private plaintiffs bringing RICO claims, which were dismissed on other grounds. To negate a defendant's claim that private RICO actions are not authorized based on Howard, you can cite the following case law:\\n\\n1. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479 (1985)\\n\\nThis Supreme Court case explicitly recognized the private right of action under RICO. The Court stated:\\n\\n'Given the plain words of the statute, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that Congress intended to limit RICO actions to those against defendants who had been convicted on criminal charges.'[1]\\n\\n2. RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Cmty., 136 S. Ct. 2090 (2016)\\n\\nThis more recent Supreme Court case reaffirmed the availability of private RICO actions, noting:\\n\\n'RICO creates a private right of action for '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation' of the statute's substantive restrictions.'[2]\\n\\n3. Painters and Allied Trades District Council 82 Health Care Fund v. Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., 943 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 2019)\\n\\nThis Ninth Circuit case, decided after Howard, clearly demonstrates that private RICO actions are still permitted within the circuit. The court reversed the dismissal of civil RICO claims, stating:\\n\\n'We conclude that the alleged misrepresentations plausibly caused physicians to prescribe, and third party payors to pay for, Actos instead of other drugs.'[9]\\n\\n4. Basic Energy Servs., LP v. Pierce, No. 4:12-CV-0220-A (N.D. Tex. Apr. 4, 2013)\\n\\nThis district court case explicitly rejected an argument similar to the one based on Howard:\\n\\n'Defendants' argument that RICO does not authorize a private right of action is without merit. The statute expressly provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court.''[7]\\n\\nThese cases clearly demonstrate that private RICO actions are authorized and continue to be recognized by courts at all levels, including the Supreme Court and within the Ninth Circuit. Howard v.

('Wells Fargo') filed a motion for summary judgment against Ferruggio Insurance Services of L.A., Inc. ('Ferruggio') on Count One of its complaint. Ferruggio had deposited a check drawn on Pacific Western Bank into its account with Wells Fargo, which was subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank. Wells Fargo sought to recover the amount of the check, $100,000, from Ferruggio. Ferruggio argued that it was not liable for the check because it had agreed with Carrillo, the payee, not to deposit the check and to use another payment method instead.\\n\\n**Key Holdings:**\\n\\n1.  **Wells Fargo is a holder of the check**: The court found that Wells Fargo became a holder of the check when it received the check for deposit, and that it was entitled to enforce the check. This decision was based on Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) Section 3-301, which defines a holder as a person who is in possession of an instrument that is payable to bearer or endorsed in a manner that transfers the right to enforce the instrument.\\n2.  **Ferruggio's defense fails**: The court found that Ferruggio's defense, that it was not liable for the check because it had agreed with Carrillo not to deposit the check, was not valid because Carrillo was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 3-302, which provides that a person who is not a holder in due course takes the instrument subject to any defenses or claims to which it is subject.\\n3.  **Wells Fargo is a holder in due course**: The court found that Wells Fargo was a holder in due course because it had taken the check in good faith and without notice of any defenses or claims. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 3-302, which defines a holder in due course as a holder who has taken an instrument without notice of any defenses or claims.\\n4.  **Wells Fargo's security interest is limited**: The court found that Wells Fargo's security interest in the check was limited to the amount of the provisional credit it had provided to the account, which was $75,278.39. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 4-205, which provides that a bank's security interest in an item is limited to the amount of the provisional credit it has provided to the customer's account.\\n\\n**Relevant Statutes and Rules:**\\n\\n*   Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.)

('Wells Fargo') initiated a motion for summary judgment against Ferruggio Insurance Services of L.A., Inc. ('Ferruggio') concerning Count One of its complaint. Ferruggio had placed a check, drawn on Pacific Western Bank, into its account with Wells Fargo, which was subsequently refused by the drawee bank. Wells Fargo aimed to recover the check amount of $100,000 from Ferruggio. Ferruggio argued that it was not responsible for the check due to an agreement with Carrillo, the payee, to not deposit the check and to opt for an alternative payment method instead.\\n\\n**Principal Rulings:**\\n\\n1.  **Wells Fargo as the check holder**: The court determined that Wells Fargo became the check holder when it received the check for deposit and was entitled to enforce the check. This conclusion was based on Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) Section 3-301, which defines a holder as a person in possession of an instrument payable to bearer or endorsed in a manner that transfers the right to enforce the instrument.\\n2.  **Ferruggio's defense dismissed**: The court ruled that Ferruggio's defense, which claimed it was not liable for the check due to an agreement with Carrillo not to deposit the check, was invalid because Carrillo was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 3-302, which states that a person who is not a holder in due course takes the instrument subject to any defenses or claims to which it is subject.\\n3.  **Wells Fargo as a holder in due course**: The court found that Wells Fargo was a holder in due course because it had taken the check in good faith and without notice of any defenses or claims.

('Wells Fargo') sought a summary judgment against Ferruggio Insurance Services of L.A., Inc. ('Ferruggio') regarding a disputed $100,000 check. Ferruggio had deposited the check, drawn on Pacific Western Bank, into its Wells Fargo account. The check was subsequently dishonored by the issuing bank. Wells Fargo aimed to recover the check amount from Ferruggio, who argued that it was not liable because it had agreed with the payee, Carrillo, not to deposit the check and to use an alternative payment method instead.\\n\\n**Principal Rulings:**\\n\\n1.  **Wells Fargo's holder status**: The court determined that Wells Fargo became a holder of the check upon receiving it for deposit, granting it the right to enforce the check. This decision was based on Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) Section 3-301, which defines a holder as a person in possession of an instrument payable to bearer or endorsed in a manner that transfers the right to enforce the instrument.\\n2.  **Ferruggio's defense dismissed**: The court rejected Ferruggio's defense, claiming it was not liable for the check due to an agreement with Carrillo not to deposit it, as Carrillo was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 3-302, which states that a person who is not a holder in due course takes the instrument subject to any defenses or claims to which it is subject.\\n3.  **Wells Fargo's holder in due course status**: The court found that Wells Fargo was a holder in due course because it took the check in good faith and without notice of any defenses or claims. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 3-302, which defines a holder in due course as a holder who has taken an instrument without notice of any defenses or claims.\\n4.  **Limited security interest for Wells Fargo**: The court determined that Wells Fargo's security interest in the check was limited to the amount of provisional credit it had provided to the account, which was $75,278.39. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 4-205, which provides that a bank's security interest in an item is limited to the amount of provisional credit it has provided to the customer's account.\\n\\n**Pertinent Laws and Regulations:**\\n\\n*   Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.)

The plaintiff argued that his loan met the criteria for a high-cost loan, thus affecting Wells Fargo's defenses.\\n- The court used **Celotex** and **Anderson** to establish that the nonmoving party must show genuine issues of material fact; here, the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence regarding the fees and charges associated with his loan.\\n- In assessing whether the loan was a high-cost loan, the court emphasized the need to consider all fees 'paid at or before closing,' rejecting the defendants' narrower interpretations that excluded financed fees.\\n- The court also found that the joint venture claims against Wells Fargo and Countrywide had sufficient evidence to warrant trial, particularly regarding their involvement with Delta Funding and the actions of its agents.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe court's decision reflects a careful examination of consumer protections under TILA and HOEPA, emphasizing the importance of proper disclosures and the ramifications for lenders when those disclosures are not adequately met.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve Board's Official Staff Interpretation of TILA and HOEPA provides important guidance on implementing these laws:\\n\\n## Key Aspects of the Official Staff Interpretation\\n\\n**TILA Provisions**\\n\\n- Clarifies which fees and charges must be included in the finance charge and APR calculations[1][4]\\n- Provides guidance on proper disclosure of credit terms, including the APR, finance charge, amount financed, and payment schedule[1]\\n- Explains requirements for rescission rights and high-cost mortgage provisions[1]\\n\\n**HOEPA Provisions** \\n\\n- Interprets the triggers for HOEPA coverage, including the APR and points/fees thresholds[4]\\n- Clarifies prohibited practices for high-cost mortgages, such as balloon payments and prepayment penalties[4]\\n- Provides guidance on additional disclosure requirements for HOEPA loans[4]\\n\\n## Significance\\n\\nThe Official Staff Interpretation serves several important purposes:\\n\\n- Provides authoritative guidance to creditors on how to comply with TILA and HOEPA requirements\\n- Helps ensure consistent application of the laws across financial institutions\\n- Clarifies ambiguities in the statutory and regulatory language\\n- Is updated periodically to address new issues and industry practices\\n\\nCreditors that rely in good faith on the Official Staff Interpretation are protected from civil liability under TILA[1].

Va 2005), heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, the plaintiff raised several issues against Wells Fargo and Countrywide. These included alleged violations of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and unconscionable contract claims under the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act (Counts I and II). Additionally, the plaintiff accused Countrywide of breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, unauthorized charges, and failure to provide statements of account (Counts III, IV, and V). Joint venture, conspiracy, and agency claims were also made against all defendants (Count VIII).\\n\\nThe court referenced several key pieces of case law in reaching its decision. These included the TILA (15 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1601 et seq.) and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) (15 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1639 and \\u00a7 1602(aa)). The court also considered precedents set in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett and Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., which provided guidance on summary judgment standards and materiality and genuineness of fact issues, respectively. Other relevant cases included Dash v. Firstplus Home Loan Trust, In re Rodrigues, Cooper v. First Government Mortgage & Inv. Corp., and Mourer v. Equicredit Corp. of America.\\n\\nAuthorities cited in the case included the West Virginia Code (W.Va.Code \\u00a7 46-3-308(b)) and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (\\u00a7 366 (1981)). The Federal Reserve Board's Official Staff Interpretation of TILA and HOEPA was also referenced.\\n\\nIn its decision, the court denied Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment on Counts I, II, and VIII, finding genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the plaintiff's loan qualified as a high-cost loan under HOEPA. This impacted Wells Fargo's holder-in-due-course defense. Countrywide's motion for summary judgment was granted on Counts I and II, but denied on Count VIII. The court ruled that Countrywide, as a loan servicer, could not be held liable for origination claims under TILA.\\n\\nThe court's reasoning was based on the principle that assignees of high-cost loans are subject to all claims and defenses a borrower could assert against the original lender under TILA and HOEPA. The plaintiff argued that his loan met the criteria for a high-cost loan, thus affecting Wells Fargo's defenses. The court also noted that the nonmoving party must show genuine issues of material fact, which the plaintiff did by presenting sufficient evidence regarding the fees and charges associated with his loan.\\n\\nThe court's decision emphasized the importance of proper disclosures under TILA and HOEPA and the ramifications for lenders when those disclosures are not adequately met. The Federal Reserve Board's Official Staff Interpretation of TILA and HOEPA provides important guidance on implementing these laws, clarifying which fees and charges must be included in the finance charge and APR calculations, providing guidance on proper disclosure of credit terms, and explaining requirements for rescission rights and high-cost mortgage provisions. The interpretation also interprets the triggers for HOEPA coverage, clarifies prohibited practices for high-cost mortgages, and provides guidance on additional disclosure requirements for HOEPA loans.\"},\n","\n","# Mayor of Baltimore v.

The definition of 'adverse action' includes actions such as the revocation of credit, which was supported by the fact that Wells Fargo claimed the entire balance was due and payable due to default.\\n  \\n- The court emphasized that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA\\u2019s notice requirement mandates that creditors provide a statement of reasons for adverse actions taken. Since Wells Fargo did not send the required notice after the alleged acceleration of the loan, the Schlegels had sufficiently stated a claim under ECOA.\\n\\n- The court distinguished between mere clerical errors and the egregious conduct alleged by the Schlegels, noting that Wells Fargo's actions went beyond mistakes, as it continued to misrepresent the status of the loan despite the Schlegels' inquiries.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nThe Ninth Circuit reversed the dismissal of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA claim, allowing the plaintiffs to proceed with their case based on Wells Fargo's failure to provide proper notification of adverse action as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA requires. The decision highlighted the importance of adhering to statutory notification requirements in credit transactions.\"},\n","\n","{\"input\": \"I was not informed by the bank when they decided to close my account.\", \"output\": \"### Case Overview: Schlegel Ex Rel.

How can I fight this off.\", \"output\": \"The case **Case v. Wells Fargo Bank NA**, 359 B.R. 709 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. 2006), revolves around several Chapter 13 debtors who allege that their mortgage creditors collected 'interest on interest' in violation of 11 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1322(e). This statute, enacted by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, limits the interest that can be charged when a debtor cures a default through a Chapter 13 plan.\\n\\n### Key Points of the Case:\\n\\n1. **Background**:\\n   - The plaintiffs are Chapter 13 debtor-mortgagors who argue that their mortgage lenders received unauthorized payments of interest on already accrued interest, essentially leading to 'interest on interest.'\\n\\n2. **Legal Context**:\\n   - The case references the precedent set by **Rake v. Wade**, where the Supreme Court allowed for 'interest on interest.' However, \\u00a7 1322(e) was introduced to counter this ruling, stating that only interest specified in the mortgage agreement should be paid during a plan.\\n\\n3. **Claims**:\\n   - The plaintiffs sought:\\n     - Disgorgement of these payments pursuant to \\u00a7 502(j) and \\u00a7 1322(e).\\n     - Abuse of process under \\u00a7 105(a).\\n     - Actual damages, attorney's fees, and class action certification.\\n\\n4. **Defendants' Motions to Dismiss**:\\n   - The defendants raised multiple defenses, including standing issues, procedural defects, and the argument that there is no private right of action under the claims asserted.\\n\\n5. **Standing**:\\n   - The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs, as Chapter 13 debtors, had standing to bring the claims on behalf of the bankruptcy estate, citing **Cable v. Ivy Tech State College** as precedent.\\n\\n6. **Procedural Deficiencies**:\\n   - The court found the adversary proceedings procedurally defective. The defendants contended that the plaintiffs should have filed a motion to reconsider under **Bankruptcy Rule 3008** rather than initiating adversary proceedings.\\n   - The plaintiffs argued that the adversary proceeding was appropriate due to their requests for injunctive relief, which requires such a format.\\n\\n7. **Court's Conclusion**:\\n   - The court ruled that the plaintiffs failed to follow the proper procedure to challenge the alleged violation of \\u00a7 1322(e). Therefore, they must proceed with a motion for reconsideration under Rule 3008 before seeking further relief.\\n   - All motions to dismiss were granted, and the court did not address other arguments raised by the defendants, deeming them unnecessary to resolve the case.\\n\\n### Significance:\\nThis case highlights the complexities of bankruptcy law, particularly regarding the rights of debtors in Chapter 13 proceedings. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of following the correct procedural channels in bankruptcy cases, specifically when disputing claims against the estate. The ruling also underscores the limitations placed on debtors regarding the recovery of alleged overpayments to creditors.\"},\n","\n","{\"input\": \"I filed for bankruptcy.

The court affirmed the district court\\u2019s dismissal of Wells Fargo's complaint for failure to state a claim.\\n2. The court held:\\n   - No violation of the Takings Clause occurred because the HOA's foreclosure did not constitute state action. The enactment of \\u00a7 116.3116 predated Wells Fargo\\u2019s lien, meaning Wells Fargo did not have the right to maintain its lien unimpaired by the HOA's lien.\\n   - Wells Fargo received constitutionally adequate notice of the foreclosure sale, as the notice complied with statutory requirements.\\n   - The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wells Fargo\\u2019s motion for reconsideration regarding the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.\\n\\n#### Reasoning for Decisions\\n- **Takings Clause**: The court reasoned that the HOA's foreclosure was private action, not state action. The statute granting superpriority to HOA liens was enacted prior to Wells Fargo's lien, thus Wells Fargo could not claim an uncompensated taking.\\n- **Due Process**: The court found that Wells Fargo had received adequate notice according to the prescribed statutory requirements. The argument that the notice was insufficient was characterized as an attack on the statute's validity rather than an as-applied challenge.\\n- **Reconsideration Motion**: The court concluded that Wells Fargo had not presented new evidence or arguments that could not have been raised earlier.\\n\\n#### Prevailing Parties\\n- The court ruled in favor of the Defendant-Appellee (Mahogany Meadows Avenue Trust and others) on all counts, affirming the district court\\u2019s decision. \"},\n","\n","{\"input\": \"The Homeowners Association I am associated with is dealing with a resident who has outstanding dues.

Nevada's statute granting priority to HOA liens was enacted before Wells Fargo's lien, thus Wells Fargo could not claim an uncompensated taking.\\n- **Due Process**: The court concluded that Wells Fargo was given adequate notice according to the statutory guidelines.

Wells Fargo Bank NA*, 297 F.R.D. 665 (M.D., Fla. 2014)\\n\\n**Court:** United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida  \\n**Date Filed:** March 26, 23  \\n **Citation:** 287 FSR 901, 30 E.G.L.R, 144  \\n\\xa0**Case Number:** No. 17-60041-CIV-TJO  \\n\\xa0\\xa0**Presiding Judge:** tomu j. osborne\\n\\n#### Case Overview\\n\\nTeresa louise lesti and Timothy jay lesti, the Plaintiffs, filed a motion to compel Wells Fargo bank, N.A. to provide information about mortgage loans, particularly concerning the frequency of foreclosures against minority borrowers. The case is significant because it involves issues of racial discrimination in mortgage lending and the defendants' duty to produce relevant documents.\\n\\n#### Relevant Case Facts\\n\\n1. **Plaintiffs' Complaint**: The Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Wells Fargo and other defendants, alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and state laws related to lending practices. They claimed that Wells Fargo engaged in discriminatory lending against minority communities.\\n\\n2. **Subpoenas Served**: The plaintiffs served subpoenas on third parties, including Equifax and LexisNexis, to obtain credit report samples and legal document analysis related to mortgage loans. They also served subpoanas on Wells Fargo to produce all documents related to the loans in question.\\n\\n3. **Defendants' Motions to Compel**: The defendants, including Wells Fargo, moved to compel the plaintiffs to narrow the scope of the subpoenas served on third party data collectors, arguing that the requests were too broad and invasive. They contended that the plaintiffs could obtain similar information through requests to individual lenders.\\n\\n4. **Concerns about Privacy**: The courts expressed concern about the potential violation of individuals' privacy rights due to the mass collection of credit report data. The decisions highlighted the importance of ensuring that such data is not accessed without proper authorization.\\n\\n5. **Relevance of Documents**: The court determined that the documents requested from Wells Fargo were likely relevant to the case and could potentially lead to admissible evidence. The court emphasized that parties should not be able to avoid document production simply by claiming that the information might be embarrassing.\\n\\n6. **Sanctions Against Plaintiffs**: Due to the plaintiffs' failure to provide necessary information and attend scheduled conferences, the court imposed sanctions. The plaintiffs were prohibited from introducing evidence related to their claims against Wells fargo or using the reports from third party subpoenaes.\\n\\n<h1>#### Court's Conclusions</h1>\\n\\n1.**Subpoenae to Third Parties**: The Court ruled that the subpoanas to Equifax ard Lexisnexis were overly broad and should be quashed. The Court cautioned against the masscollection of credit repor<strong><h2>Sanctions</h2></strong>\\n\\n**Sanctions against Plaintiffs**: The sanctions imposed on the Plaintiffs were severe, preventing them from using any evidence relatedto their claims agianst Wells Fargo or the reports obtained through the subponeas. This decision was made due to their failure to comply with the Court'ss orders and provide necessary informationsuch as anonymized credit reports.\\n\\n**2.*** **Supervisory Orders**: The supervisory orders issued by the Court aimed to ensure that the collection of data from Equifaxand LexisNexus would be conducted in a manner that respects individuals'privacy rights. The orders required the Plaintiffs to obtain informed consent from the individuals involvedand to limit the collection to documents that are actually relevant to their case.<br>\\n\\n**3.*** **Motion to Compell**: The Courts determination that the movant, Equifax, should produce the documentsrequested by the Plaintiffs indicates that the dokumenpackage's relevance outweighed the movants claimsof privacy protection. This deciision reinforces the principle that parties shimportantly, the Court emphasized that the Plaintiffs have an obligation to make reasonable efforts to obtain the documents they need directly from the parties involved.\\n\\n<h4>4.*** **Relevance to Case**: The documents collected, which included credit reports for specific borrowersand communication#I<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n\\nThe rulings in this case highlight the importanceof balancing the need to collect evidence with the protectionof individuale<b>[aarrggbb]}]InfjspxThis balance is particularly relevant in cases involving consumer lendingsuch as the one at hand, where sensitive financial information is exchanged//Weніципалі}*/\\r\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_0 = \"What rights do I have with my credit cards and home loan as a borrower?\"\n","response_0 = inference_pipeline(prompt_0)\n","response_0"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"id":"vy25AoKrSg1n","outputId":"b40d2816-2633-400d-e1f3-fcd5703d4dd5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736403566012,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":257400,"user":{"displayName":"David Thrower","userId":"01809246225080656148"}}},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'\\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), enshrined in 15 U.S. Code § 1691, is a federal civil rights law enacted on October 28, 1974, aimed at ensuring fairness in credit transactions and prohibiting discrimination. Here\\'s a detailed overview of the rights and provisions established by the ECOA:\\n\\n## Prohibition Against Discrimination\\nThe ECOA forbids creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of:\\n- Race\\n- Color\\n- Religion\\n- National origin\\n- Sex (including gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity)\\n- Marital status\\n- Age (if the applicant is legally able to enter into a contract)\\n-</<h1>>Receipt of income under any public or private program designed to assist low or moderate income persons\\n-</ Wicidata>\\n\\n## Scope of Protection\\nThe protections extended by theECOAc<h2>Rights of Consumers</h2>\\n1. **Fair Evaluation of Creditworthiness**: You have the right to have your creditworthiness assessed using consistent standards applied to all applicants.\\n2. **Equal Access to Credit**: You<strong>not</strong> be denied credit opportunities due to your protected characteristics.\\n3. **Clear Explanations**: If your application is rejected, you are entitled to a written explanation, excluding confidential information.\\n4. **Marital Rights**: You cannot be penalized for sharing finances with your spouse, nor can you be required to have a spouse co-sign if they are not involved in the transaction.\\n5. **Public Assistance Protection**: You are safeguarded against discrimination if you receive income from public or privately funded assistance programs.\\n6. **Senior Citizen Rights**: If you are over 65, you must be informed if your ability to repay is questioned due to age.\\n\\n<h2>Actions You Can Take If Your Rights Are Violated</h2>\\nIf you believe your ECOA rights have been infringed upon:\\n1.**Document Everything**: Gather evidence, such as applications, communications, and witness statements.\\n<%<package deal>\\n2.**File a Complaint**: Submit a complaint to the creditor in writing, requesting an investigation.\\nIn case of a bank, send the complaint to their headquarters.\\nIf dealing with a non-bank creditor, report to the appropriate agency.\\n presidencial candidate challenging the constitutionality of a law must prove that the law affects them personally. This requirement is known as the principle of standing. In the case of Bah v. Wells Fargo Bank NA, the claim of discriminatory lending under the ECOAct was dismissed due to the lack of standing on the part of the plaintiff. The court ruled that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to establish that they had been directly harmed by the defendant\\'s actions.\\n\\n### References\\n1.<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/ perumahan-discriminatory-practices#:~:text=In%20the%2120%2FCase%2förs\\'%20of%2 hivatkozások=%AnchorStylesimportantly%2C%2<h3>Authorities Cited</h3>\\n- United%2 szolg invokingState invokingState#:%ynchronously%2Caps% mengajar<b>IThis%2AndEndTagAndEndTagAndEndTag//We[ berperilaku<em><?*BibitemShut<h4>Bah\\ufeffItAsymptomaticallyHi/*\\ufeff/**    constতথ্যসূত্রViited térmicoByTikang illnesses<blockquote>Upon Administrativna AdministrativnaИскәрмәләрәрмәләр]:% مرئيهftagPoolftagPoolftagPool myſelf“MENAFN חיצונייםПриміткиագրություններ CURIAM.% $_\"(+:+[toxicity=0]citenamefont víctimasharusnya\\u3000\\u3000For期刊论文You<h1> שולייםCyfeiriadau</h1>>%rungsseite referenties\"\\ue315<h1> nahilalakip चीज़ोंWhen\\\\{\\\\\\\\ queſta'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":25}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","REPO = f\"{YOUR_HF_USERNAME}/{CUSTOM_MODEL_NAME}\"\n","adapted_model.push_to_hub(REPO,\n","                          token=ACCESS_TOKEN_HF)\n","tokenizer.push_to_hub(REPO,\n","                      token=ACCESS_TOKEN_HF)\n","config =  adapted_model.config\n","\n","# Save and push the config\n","config.save_pretrained(\"./temp_config-3\")\n","config.push_to_hub(REPO,\n","                   token=ACCESS_TOKEN_HF)"],"metadata":{"id":"-yYjXeadVWun","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":371,"referenced_widgets":["baea68d9c10c471999070ff5d3bbf5aa","c74b7ea1afa14862ae8f838e2f7c00a3","1aa55835ad4948dc9bf7f1eb1cdd5258","08ce0d26a1ab47c6a5cbf428dfb813aa","e33112fbbdad416594d3ff77d671dfa1","93d4869487a34c80879caceebb6491d4","79bd1b7a766949ec897b59eba21f15e7","82c2976140b4400ebd36262237a20452","057da7e7bce048a9b6f60b58c4e7e9f9","b753abc45b554a8fa8d479395a8e927f","66c757c80cde469d8789a9caa7698024","0d988eccf7a94200b465967b52b7ab5d","92e02ac11ced466e8e6f60241cc14e72","b747694d0de74bd18278e6ea2c657b74","00434d1e80f24eb38e2ed6999235bdec","55b8b6f3464d43e98a6f1f3b8738587b","08238b638b594ca1865f9aebabfe7974","a4ddd370ac094231b98a4ae04e0e7149","3b37e396c32344c48d29ffab33131bc5","1f893615571240fcbbdd796347ba5dd2","a31a3c5bebf946f69429fa4c74ab680a","91e54607fe6e4265990eb1a2f23a8539","317c4101f8364841a9ba55df6ed751ff","3042cd28a6704c9da6fdb5c24e098308","9aee09d4726f4dd8b75b1d02dedc9fd4","1193845525ac4a1f894b9f3099adebc9","69e6b29f46134548898b3bef5b5f7d87","f1ed859f21ff4cadb84af9e6c3505d7e","2a874d4a6d8b463f821dee79f18d1aeb","7ddcc24ac54b48aea76745c9e6e247f2","f41c1c13f32d4e55b67f16ecb9cfae06","48b28b89a6fd4343a60448dd2c1390dd","a51ba886f77e4853b79406c41127cec2","cbed997471ae4361b3a6e509175fbeca","8af569264d4a41ea823b802c79f280ee","11b079d9253c44138329cd56314880fb","7dadd53fde09404fb3971952cf88787a","26801863adc04efd8a815c3a2bc8c634","44d329b1eb29458f9af41e06b5ceda63","f95a58fcf4fc4dc188494f9b05dc3ac4","fbee185c92d54612ab0351564cf59571","95e05abd635b40399a07f09a257b6cf1","fd0ee24677ce490380de50e2dccf2386","68ed46fe3d164f67898c3472a2705904","83edab931733404dba4df148834a37af","7222e6c803bd4870913f0524a7bdb176","444d51df107a45e5a399bc41d97e2d8e","c70a82dd44354d61aaf15714a35d7362","132069d30ed94e43a3932c860642ea4c","da9439a14ca84138b38f6b0f9d6df033","7b9e251103744ff68636147ac67540f1","c085057c518540918c8aecf3370601fd","525779c00e6c41d9a46f15923a6c52b5","ed9033bb73da4a1199ef864d1faa8171","11510b8ba63a452b99ffab62b4acb7c3"]},"outputId":"ad7bb9a2-3edf-4777-e517-3c1d7ace7b49","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736401961603,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":26421,"user":{"displayName":"David Thrower","userId":"01809246225080656148"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/peft/utils/other.py:716: UserWarning: Unable to fetch remote file due to the following error 401 Client Error.

Here’s a comprehensive summary of the rights and provisions established by the ECOA:\\n\\n## Protection Against Discrimination\\nThe ECOA prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants based on:\\n- Race\\n- Color\\n- Religion\\n- National origin\\n- Sex (including gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity)\\n- Marital status\\n- Age (if the applicant has the capacity to contract)\\n-(Retaliation for exercising rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act)\\n\\n## Scope of Protection\\nThe protections under ECOA apply to:\\nLandlords with four or more units who conduct credit checks\\nAny person or organization extending credit\\nAdvertising of credit terms\\nAny organization setting terms for public accommodations with a credit arrangement\\n\\n## Rights of Applicants\\nUnder the ECOa, applicants have the right to:\\n\\nBe treated equally regardless of protected characteristics\\nHave reasons for denial explained in writing\\nNot have marital status considered against them\\nBe informed about their right to have payments made directly to the creditor\\nKnow that security measures will be taken only after credit is granted\\nBe aware that credit will not be denied solely due to payment by check\\n\\n## Limits on Considering Race and Religion\\nCreditors cannot:\\nFactor in an applicant's race or color when making credit decisions\\nUse religious affiliation as a factor in credit evaluations\\n\\n## Restrictions on Marital Status\\nCredit considerations cannot be based on marital status, and spouses cannot be required to apply together.\\n\\n## Prohibition on Retaliation\\nIt is illegal for creditors to take adverse action against individuals for asserting their rights under ECOAsubmissions.\\n\\n### Enforcement and Recourse\\nThe Department of Justice enforces the ECOAs civil rights provisions, while private parties can file lawsuits for violations. Remedies may include damages, injunctions, and attorney fees.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nThe EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT is a crucial piece of legislation that guarantees fair lending procedures and safeguards against discrimination. Both creditors and credit applicants must be aware of their respective rights and obligations under the ECOAcould be revised to incorporate specific examples and case references for better comprehension.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Conclusion:  Success!**\n","\n","We've successfully tamed Gemma-2 with the power of LoRA and DoRA!  Not only have we customized its behavior to our liking, but we've done it efficiently, right here on a simple free Colab instance.  We've laid the foundation for a personalized LLMs, ready to tackle your own tasks.\n","\n","## **Level Up: Next Steps**\n","\n","This demo is a great starting point, but let's make it even *better*!  Here's what we can add to this:\n","\n","1. **Validation:** Debug the issues that mixed precision and  quantization is creating when using a validation set with this trainer, so we can track the perplexity metric out of sample.   \n","2. **Real world data:**  Adapt this to solve a real world problem.  \n","3. **JSONL** Add a JSONL file loading step for training and validation data.\n","4. **ETL Pipeline:** Add an ETL pipeline to make it practical to load longer input/output samples and transform them to clean JSONL samples.\n","5. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  Add Optuna as a tuner and nest the training task in a parameterized obtective() function so Optuna can find the optimal hyperparameters. Even better, set up a distributed training / tuning job with Kubeflow and Katib or with Vertex AI, etc. The hyperparameters which I guessed by rule of thumb and some that are wildly unusual to compensate for a very small sample, they clearly work for this simple example, but they may be far from perfect and likely to be suboptimal for a scaled - up data set for solving a real problem.\n","6. **MLflow Integration:**  The weights & Biases default setup works, but MLflow may provide much better ML Metadata tracking and ML artifact accessioning.\n","\n","**Contributions and forks welcome!
