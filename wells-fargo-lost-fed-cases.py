# Permute the following opinion with the following example prompts

# Prompt 1: The Overly-Simplified Summary "Write an argument for my case against Wells Fargo. They gave me a loan, I defaulted on it, and now they're suing. I say it's discharged because of bankruptcy. Wells fargo claims that I am responsible for proving affirmative defenses like  the fact that the loan was gaurenteed. Write an argument that proves I am in the right that they must prove this and failing to respond to a questions I didn't understand doesn't meet that burden."

# Prompt 2: Focusing on Procedural Issues (and Missing the Point) "Wells Fargo's lawyer didn't follow the rules! In my case, they didn't properly file their summary judgment motion. Their motion should be denied. Right? Please summarize a good arguemnt like why Local Rule 56(a) helps me win."

# Prompt 3: Misunderstanding the Burden of Proof "I need help arguing that my Wells Fargo loan is dischargeable. Help me hold Wells Fargo accountable for their responsibility to prove their affirmative defense."

# Prompt 4: The "Wells Fargo hid confusing terms in the fien print that I didn't understand, now they calim it is my responsibility to disprove their affirmative defense. Explain why their reasoning is incorrect."

# Write a statement of case facts that provide that a motion not responded to does not count as admitted in cases of fact around a gaurenteed loan

INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Memorandum of Decision sets forth the rationale for the Court's determination of a Motion for Summary Judgment (hereafter, the \"Motion\"), Doc. I.D. No. 9, filed by Defendant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (hereafter, \"Wells Fargo\"). As more fully explained hereafter, notwithstanding the Debtors' failure to file requisite pleadings responsive to the Motion, and the \"deemed admitted\" consequences thereby attaching to all of Wells Fargo's asserted facts, Wells Fargo's failure to address a fundamental element of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8) is fatal to the Motion.\n\nII. JURISDICTION\n\nThe United States District Court for the District of Connecticut has subject matter jurisdiction over the instant adversary proceeding by virtue of 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b); and this Court derives its authority to hear and determine this matter on reference from the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 157(a), (b)(1). This is a \"core proceeding\" pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(I).\n\nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nOn August 16, 2001, Henry J. Woolford and Laurie-Jean A. Woolford (hereafter, the \"Debtors\" or \"Plaintiffs\") commenced the instant bankruptcy case by filing a joint voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors listed a \"consolidation loan\" in the amount of $62,000.00 to Wells Fargo (hereafter, the \"Loan\") on Schedule F (Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims). A Discharge Order entered on December 11, and the case was closed on December 27, 2001. On August 21, 2003, the Debtors filed, pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 350(b), a Motion to Re-open Case (hereafter, the \"Motion to Reopen\") accompanied by an Application to Determine Dischargeability of Debt (hereafter, the \"Complaint\"). The Complaint sought a determination of dischargeability concerning the Loan, and alleged, inter alia, that Wells Fargo had recently initiated a collection action in the Connecticut state courts related to the Loan. By Order dated October 1, 2003, the Motion to Reopen was granted.[1]\n\nOn March 18, 2004, Wells Fargo filed the Motion, supported in accordance with applicable local rules by a Statement of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Issue (hereafter, the \"Local Rule 56(a)l Statement\"),[2] Doc. I.D. No. 11, and *107 Defendant's Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. I.D. No. 10. The Debtors sought and received a 15-day extension of time to respond to the Motion, but have not timely filed the required Local Rule 56(a)2 Statement or otherwise responded to the Motion.[3]\n\nIV. DEEMED ADMITTED FACTS\n\nThe following facts, inter alia, are deemed admitted pursuant to Local Rule 56(a)l as a consequence of the Debtors' failure to submit a timely Local Rule 56(a)2 Statement:[4]\n\n1. On July 25, 1996, the Debtors jointly executed a Consolidated Loan Application & Promissory Note (hereafter, the \"Note\") for an educational consolidation loan.\n\n2. After the Debtors' execution of the Note, and in reliance thereon, Wells Fargo disbursed $55,592.95 to the Debtors under the Note (hereafter, the \"Loan Proceeds\").\n\n3. The Debtors have previously representedboth in the Note and in a loan worksheet (hereafter, the \"Worksheet\") that the Loan Proceeds were used for educational purposes. For instance, 1110 of the Note states that \"I understand that the loan is an education loan ....\" In addition, at ¶ 9, the Note contained the following covenant:\n\n    The proceeds of this Note will be used solely for tuition and other reasonable education expenses including, but not limited to fees, books, supplies and equipment, laboratory expenses, transportation and commuting costs, and personal expenses of the student or for the refinancing of debt (Prior Debt) incurred solely for payment of the preceding expenses.\n\nMoreover, the Worksheet contained numerous references to the educational nature of the subject loan program, and to the condition that the Loan Proceeds had to be used for educational purposes. As examples, the Worksheet provides as follows: (i) \"[p]lease use this worksheet to itemize the education loans you wish to include in your loan consolidation\"; (ii) \"[y]ou may only consolidate the portion of your credit card which was expended for educational expenses\"; (iii) \"each loan being refinanced with proceeds of this loan was obtained and used solely for the purpose of financing education expenses.\"\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Applicable Law.\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), made applicable to this proceeding by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, directs that summary judgment shall enter when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\nWhen ruling on motions for summary judgment, \"the judge's function is not ... to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., All U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party has the burden of showing that there are no material facts *108 in dispute and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn, and all ambiguities resolved in favor of the non-moving party. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970).\n\nLocal Rule 56(a) of the Local Civil Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (heretofore and hereafter, \"Local Rule(s)\") supplements Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) by requiring statements of material fact from each party to a summary judgment motion.[5] Under the Local Rule 56(a)1, the material facts set forth in a movant's statement \"will be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the statement required to be filed and served by the opposing party ....\" Local Rule 56(a) should be \"strictly interpreted, and failure to properly controvert facts in opposing a summary judgment motion is an appropriate consideration in granting the motion.\" Ross v. Shell Oil Co., 672 F. Supp. 63, 66 (D.Conn.1987) (construing former Local Rule 9(c)).\n\nB. Analysis of the Present Matter.\n\nThrough their Complaint's request for a declaration that the Wells Fargo debt arose from \"an unsecured consolidation loan and not ... a non-dischargeable student loan\" (emphasis added), Complaint, I 5, the Debtor-Plaintiffs seek to avoid the application of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8) to such debt. Section 523(a) describes a non-dischargeable student loan, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n    A discharge under Section 727 ... of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt\n\n* * * * *\n\n    (8) for an educational ... loan made, insured or guaranteed by a government unit, or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution.... *109 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8) (2001). Thus, Section 523(a)(8) renders a debt non-dischargeable only if two elements are present: (i) the underlying loan was \"educational\" in nature; and (ii) that loan was made or enabled under the auspices of a governmental unit or non-profit institution.\n\nWhile the summary judgment record before the Court amply supports the educational nature of the Loan, it wholly fails to establish that the Loan was \"made, insured or guaranteed by a government unit, or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution\". No facts germane to this latter element are presented in the Complaint, the Answer or, of greatest significance to the present matter, the Local Rule 56(a)l Statement.[6]\n\nDespite the paucity of the record on this critical element, the Court has independently scoured the documents submitted as Exhibits to Wells Fargo's summary judgment submissions (ie. the Note and Worksheet) for information on the auspices of the Loan. The only information bearing on that fact is contained in the \"boilerplate\" on the reverse of the Note. Paragraph 10 thereof, titled \"Miscellaneous\", states that the Debtors \"understand that [the] loan is made under a program which is funded in whole or in part by a non-profit organization, University Support Services, Inc.....\" (hereafter, the \"Nonprofit Covenant\"). Nonetheless, the Court does not deem such \"fact\" as established in this matter, as it is not included in any pleading, and more particularly, is not stated or referenced as a separate assertion within the body of the Local Rule 56(a) 1 Statement. More fundamentally however, even if the Court were to deem the Nonprofit Covenant to be stated in the Local Rule 56(a) 1 Statement, it would not establish a relevant fact. The fact that the Debtors represented that they understood the loan to be funded by a nonprofit institution does not, in fact, make it so. Wells Fargo had the burden on summary judgment to establish actual nonprofit funding, not merely that the Debtors believed it to be a fact.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Wells Fargo's Motion for Summary Judgment must be DENIED.\nNOTES\n\n[1] See, e.g., In re Keenom, 231 B.R. 116 (Bankr. M.D.Ga.1999); In re Mendiola, 99 B.R. 864, 870 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1989). (\"There are [only] three ways to litigate dischargeability after a case is closed. First, if a creditor pursues a lawsuit on a claim, the debtor can assert the bankruptcy discharge as an affirmative defense and the court with jurisdiction over that lawsuit can decide whether the debt falls within any of the exceptions to discharge. Second, under Bankruptcy Rule 4007(b) either the debtor or the creditor can move to reopen [the] case for the purpose of filing a complaint to determine dischargeability. Third, the debtor can bring an action in this Court to enforce the discharge injunction against a creditor attempting to collect discharged claims....\" (emphasis added)).\n\n[2] Wells Fargo filed the Local Rule 56(a) 1 Statement pursuant to Local Rule 9(c) which has been superceded by Local Rule 56(a) (effective January 1, 2003; and amended effective August 1, 2003). For purposes of the determination made herein, Local Rule 56(a) is identical to former Local Rule 9(c).\n\n[3] The Debtors' responsive pleadings were due, initially and as extended, on April 8 and April, 23, 2004, respectively. See Local Rule 7(a) 1, made applicable to this proceeding by D. Conn. LBR 1001-l(b).\n\n[4] See part V. DISCUSSION, infra.\n\n[5] Local Rule 56(a), entitled \"Motions for Summary Judgment\", applicable to this proceeding by D. Conn. LBR 1001-l(b), states in pertinent part as follows:\n\n1. There shall be annexed to a motion for summary judgment a document entitled \"Local Rule 56(a) 1 Statement\", which sets forth in separately numbered paragraphs a concise statement of each material fact as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried. All material facts set forth in said statement will be deemed admitted unless controverted by the statement required to be filed and served by the opposing party in accordance with Local Rule 56(a)2.\n\n2. The papers opposing a motion for summary judgment shall include a document entitled \"Local Rule 56(a)2 Statement,\" which states in separately numbered paragraphs corresponding to the paragraphs contained in the moving party's Local Rule 56(a)l Statement whether each of the facts asserted by the moving party is admitted or denied. The Local Rule 56(a)2 Statement must also include in a separate section entitled \"Disputed Issues of Material Fact\" a list of each issue of material fact as to which it is contended there is a genuine issue to be tried.\n\n3 Each statement of a material fact by a movant in a Local Rule 56(a) 1 Statement or by an opponent in a Local Rule 56(a)2 Statement, and each denial in an opponent's Local Rule 56(a)2 Statement, must be followed by a specific citation to (1) the affidavit of a witness competent to testify as to the facts at trial and/or (2) evidence that would be admissible at trial. The affidavits, deposition testimony, responses to discovery requests, or other documents containing such evidence shall be filed and served with the Local Rule 56(a)l and 2 Statements in conformity with Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Counsel and pro se parties are hereby notified that failure to provide specific citations to evidence in the record as required by this Local Rule may result in sanctions, including, when the movant fails to comply, an order denying the motion for summary judgment, and, when the opponent fails to comply, an order granting the motion.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n[6] Nor does Wells Fargo's Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment provide any argument on this element."},

{"input":"Write a statement of case facts that explains reasons why a case for breach of contract against the plaintiff should not be dismissed","output":"\n Background\n\n Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese bought a *759car from Cresmont Chrsyler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. To finance the car, they entered into a Retail Installment Sales Contract with Cresmont. Cresmont subsequently assigned the contract to Defendant Wells Fargo. A choice-of-law provision states that Federal law and Ohio law shall apply to the contract. The contract also provides that, in the event of default and repossession,\n\n    [Wells Fargo] will sell the vehicle if you do not get it back. If you do not do what 'is required to get the vehicle back, we will sell the vehicle.\n\n    [Wells Fargo] will apply the money from the sale, less allowed expenses, to the amount you owe. Alowed expenses are expenses we pay as a direct result of taking the vehicle, holding it, preparing it for sale, and selling it.\n\n(Doc#: 1-2).\n\nIn September 2011, Plaintiffs defaulted on the loan, and Defendant repossessed the vehicle. On September 14, 2011, Defendant issued to Plaintiffs a “Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property” (“Notice of Sale”) informing them the vehicle would be sold at public auction. Defendant also sent a “Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle” (“Redemption Notice”) advising Plaintiffs of their right of redemption.\n\nAccording to the Notice of Sale, the public sale would occur on October 20, 2011; in fact, the sale was not held until November 3, 2011. The Notice of Sale stated the minimum acceptable bid would be $14,850; the actual selling price, however, was $9,600. Defendant applied the sale proceeds to the balance due under the contract, though it was not enough to make up for the deficiency. Defendant therefore sent Plaintiffs a Deficiency Notice, which included, among other charges, “collection fees” in the amount of $1291.21.\n\nIn an effort to recover the deficiency and the collection fees, Defendant filed suit against Plaintiffs in state court, asserting its right to retain the vehicle in accordance with Ohio Revised Code (“ORC”) § 1317.02. Defendant later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.1\n\nIn this putative class action, Plaintiffs allege Defendant committed multiple violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (“RISA”), O.R.C. § 1317.01 et seq., and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (“OUCC”), O.R.C. § 1309.101 et seq., by failing to disclose the correct date of the public sale, by failing to disclose the correct minimum bid, by failing to conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and by charging prohibited fees — “collection fees.” Plaintiffs also assert breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims.\n\nPlaintiffs seek class certification, an order declaring Defendant’s acts unlawful, an injunction preventing Defendant from seeking to collect any alleged deficiencies, an order declaring that any alleged deficiencies of the proposed class members are not owed, an order requiring Defendant to remove any adverse credit information previously reported to credit reporting organizations, restitution, compensatory damages, statutory damages, pre- and postjudgment interest, attorney fees, costs, and expenses.\n\nII. Standard of Review\n\nDefendants’ pending 12(b)(6) motion seeks dismissal of all of Plaintiffs’ claims. A 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive a motion to dismiss, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on *760its face.’ ” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 550, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id.\n\nIII. Statutory Claims\n\nDefendant does not deny it failed to comply with RISA and OUCC. Instead, it argues the statutory claims are preempted by the National Banking Act (“NBA”), 12 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and the implementing regulations promulgated by the Office of Comptroller Currency (“OCC”). Congress has authorized the OCC to promulgate those regulations. 12 U.S.C. § 93a; Fid. Fed. Savs. & Loan Ass’n v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 152, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982).\n\nThere are three ways federal law may preempt state law: express preemption; field preemption; and obstacle preemption. First, a state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly so states. See Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S. 519, 525, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977). Second, Congress can so extensively regulate a given industry that, in effect, the federal government “occupies the field” and leaves no room for state regulation. See Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947). Third, a state law will not be effective against federal law if the state law functions “as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25, 31, 116 S.Ct. 1103, 134 L.Ed.2d 237 (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941)). While the courts have carved out these three categories of preemption, they are often conflated with one another, and, as a result, demand a hybrid analysis that requires pulling from one category to fully analyze another. See, e.g., Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, 675 F.3d 315, 323 (4th Cir.2012) (combining express and conflict analysis).\n\nDefendant argues that the NBA and OCC regulations fall under all three preemption categories. First, Defendant argues that 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(d) expressly preempts state laws like RISA and the OUCC. Second, Defendant argues that because there is such a long history of federal regulation of the banking industry, there is a strong presumption in favor of preemption as the federal government has “occupied the field.” Third, Defendant argues that RISA and the OUCC are in conflict with federal law and therefore create an obstacle to the bank’s exercise of its powers because they prevent the bank from collecting entirely on money that had previously been lent.\n\nA. Express Preemption\n\nThe state laws at issue in this case, RISA and the OUCC, require creditors to follow specified procedures when repossessing and disposing of consumers’ vehicles. O.R.C. § 1317.12 reads in pertinent part:\n\n    [I]f collateral for a consumer transaction is taken possession of by the secured party on default, the secured party shall, within five business days after taking possession, send to the debtor a notice setting forth specifically the circumstances constituting the default and the amount by itemization that the debtor is required to pay to cure the default. Any notice required by section 1309.611 or 1317.16 of the Revised Code may be included as part of the notice required by this section.\n*761Section 1317.16(B) specifies that disposition of collateral may be made at public sale only and that:\n\n    At least ten days prior to sale the secured party shall send notification of the time and place of such sale and of the minimum price for which such collateral will be sold, together with a statement that the debtor may be held liable for any deficiency resulting from such sale, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the debtor at the debtor’s last address known to the secured party, and to any persons known by the secured party to have an interest in the collateral. nAs a penalty for failing to abide by these notice requirements, O.R.C. § 1317.12 provides that “[a] secured party who disposes of the collateral without sending notice required by this section may not recover the costs of retaking possession of the collateral and is not entitled to a deficiency judgment.”\n\nThe OUCC has similar notification requirements, including a provision requiring a secured party to send a notice of disposition stating “the time and place, by identifying the place of business or address or by providing other information that, in each case, reasonably describes the location, of a public disposition or the time after which any other disposition is to be made.” O.R.C. § 1309.613(A)(1)(e). In addition to the notice provisions, § 1309.610(B) requires that “[e]very aspect of a disposition of collateral, including the method, manner, time, place, and other terms, must be commercially reasonable.” The punishment for violating the OUCC notice provisions includes statutory damages in the amount of the “credit service charge” plus ten (10%) percent of the principal amount borrowed. O.R.C. § 1309.625(C)(2).\n\nDefendant argues that 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(d), an OCC regulation, preempts RISA and the OUCC. That regulation provides:\n\n    A national bank may make non-real estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning:\n\n    (8) Disclosure and advertising, including laws requiring specific statements, information, or other content to be included in credit application forms, credit solicitations, billing statements, credit contracts, or other credit-related documents.\n\n12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(d) (emphasis added); (Doc # : 7 at 6). Defendant argues that repossession notices qualify as “other credit-related documents” and, therefore, state laws concerning repossession notice requirements — including RISA and OUCC— are expressly preempted.\n\nDefendant’s argument fails to take account of the words that accompany the phrase “other credit-related documents”: information to be included in “credit application forms,” “credit solicitations,” “billing statements,” and “credit contracts.” 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(d)(8). Yet it is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep — noscitur a sociis: “all the words used in a list should be read together and given related meaning when construing a statute or regulation.” Aguayo v. U.S. Bank, 653 F.3d 912, 927 (citing Schreiber v. Burlington N., Inc., 472 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 2458, 86 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)). The associated words suggest that “other credit-related documents” relates to the documentation in the early stages of loan activi*762ty: disclosures and advertisements that occur during the initiation phase of a loan. The phrase does not apply to the end stages of loan activity: collecting on a debt or repossessing the collateral securing the debt. Furthermore, Defendant’s argument fails to construe the text of the regulation as a whole by ignoring — and giving no effect to — the savings provision in the very next subsection of the regulation. The savings provision lists several kinds of state laws that are not preempted by the regulations, including state laws having to do with debt collection:\n\n    (e) State laws that are not preempted. State laws on the following subjects are not inconsistent with the non-real estate lending powers of national banks and apply to national banks to the extent consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, et al., 517 U.S. 25[, 116 S.Ct. 1103, 134 L.Ed.2d 237] (1996):\n\n    (4) Rights to collect debts.\n\n12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(e) (emphasis added).\n\nRISA and the OUCC qualify as laws involving “rights to collect debts.” A debt is liability on a claim. Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009). Collection is the process through which an item passes. Id. Repossession is the act of retaking goods sold on credit when the buyer has failed to pay for them. Id. If consumers fail to abide by the terms of a contract, under RISA, they become indebted on that contract. O.R.C. § 1317.03. If consumers are indebted, the retail seller under the contract, or a holder of that contract, has a claim against the consumer. Id. This claim includes the enforceable right of repossession. O.R.C. § 1317.12. Prior to enforcing this right in court, RISA and the OUCC require that a creditor make certain notifications to a debtor during the process of repossession of collateral. See, e.g., id.; O.R.C. § 1309.613. If these notification requirements are not met, the creditor “may not recover the costs of retaking possession of the collateral and is not entitled to a deficiency judgment.” O.R.C. §§ 1317.12; 1309.625(C)(2).\n\nThe RISA and the OUCC provisions at issue in this case involve a regulatory scheme governing repossession of motor vehicles as an aspect of debt collection; they thus qualify as laws governing “rights to collect debts.” Repossession notices are not “other credit-related documents” related to “disclosure and advertising.” Accordingly, RISA and the OUCC fall within the ambit of the savings provision, 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(e)(4), and outside the scope of the express preemption provision.\n\nThe only courts to have addressed these OCC regulations and state-law notice requirements relating to repossession have reached the same conclusion. See Aguayo v. U.S. Bank, 653 F.3d 912 (9th Cir.2011), cert. denied, U.S. Bank Nat. Ass’n v. Aguayo, — U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 106, 184 L.Ed.2d 23 (2012); and Epps, 675 F.3d 315, 323 (4th Cir.2012). The facts in Aguayo and Epps are identical to the facts in this case: a state law required certain information be provided to a debtor once a vehicle has been repossessed, and the notice sent to the debtor tracked the language of that law but was deficient in the same ways now alleged in this case. See Aguayo, 653 F.3d at 916;2 Epps, 675 F.3d at 318. 3\n\nThe Aguayo court started its analysis with the words that begin § 7.4008(d)(8): “Disclosure and advertising.” 653 F.3d at 916. The court explained that “[t]he term ‘disclosure’ is commonly used to refer to an informational statement of terms prior to entering a transaction.” 653 F.3d at 916 (emphasis added). Per § 7.4008(d)(8), these “disclosures” include “specific statements, information, or other content to be included in credit application forms, credit solicitations, billing statements, credit contracts, or other credit-related documents.” 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(d)(8). The court recognized,\n\n    [t]he choice and arrangement of words in the OCC regulation, starting with “[disclosures and advertising” and followed by “including,” indicate that the later words are meant to be examples of types of disclosure and advertising — two words that generally mean to present information to the public, particularly before or in the process of consummating a transaction.\n\nAguayo, 653 F.3d at 927. “A notice, on the other hand, is a specific communication of a claim or demand submitted to a party in the course of, or at the conclusion of, a transaction.” Id. at 927. The Fourth Circuit, in Epps, found the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning persuasive and agreed “that the notices here, which only relate to debt collection upon default under an existing loan, are not ‘disclosures’ within the meaning of the [NBA] and OCC regulations.” 675 F.3d at 324. In sum, both the Ninth and Fourth Circuits courts have held that § 7.4008(d)(8) does not expressly preempt state laws relating to repossession notice requirements.\n\nDefendant is not dissuaded by these cases and, for support, Defendant cites Crespo v. WFS Financial, Inc., 580 F.Supp.2d 614 (N.D.Ohio 2008). There the court had to construe a regulation with an express preemption clause similar to the express preemption clause in 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(d). The court concluded that state laws imposing post-possession notice requirements are expressly preempted. Id.\n\nDespite appearances, Crespo is not on point because the regulations at issue in that case, which were promulgated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, do not contain a savings provision exempting laws related to debt collection. Compare 12 C.F.R. § 560.2 with 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(e); Crespo, 580 F.Supp.2d 614. See also Aguayo, *764653 F.3d at 921-922 (finding Crespo distinguishable).\n\nThe Court finds that 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008 does not expressly preempt the repossession notice requirements in either RISA or OUCC.\n\nB. Field Preemption\nB. Field Preemption\nDefendant also argues that RISA and the OUCC are preempted by virtue of the fact that Congress has extensively regulated in the banking industry, such that there is a presumption that the federal government has occupied the field. To support this position, Defendant again relies upon the ruling in Crespo. Again, this reliance is misplaced.\nThe court in Aguayo observed,\n[Wjhile the [Office of Thrift Supervision] and OCC regulations are similar in many ways, compare 12 C.F.R. § 560.2(b), (c), with, 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(d), (e), the OCC has explicitly avoided full field preemption in its rule-making and has not been granted full field preemption by Congress. Compare 12 C.F.R. § 560.2(a) (occupying the field) with, e.g., OCC, Final Rule, 69 Fed. Reg. 1904-01, 1910-11 (Jan. 13, 2004), 2004 WL 50763 (“[W]e decline to adopt the suggestion of these commenters that we declare that these regulations ‘occupy the field’ ... ”).\n653 F.3d at 921-22.\nIndeed, any doubt the OTC has not occupied the field of debt collection is readily dispelled by the savings clause and its specific exemption for laws related to the right to collect debts. See Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens, 589 F.3d 274 (6th Cir.2009) (finding that the National Bank Act “does not preempt general state laws governing the rights ... to collect debts.”).\nC. Obstacle Preemption\nState laws are preempted if they significantly interfere with a bank’s exercise of its powers. Id. Defendant asserts that RISA and the OUCC significantly interfere with its powers because the statutory notification requirements “premise Wells Fargo’s ability to be repaid by defaulted auto loan borrowers upon detailed state law disclosure requirements.” (Doc # : 7 at 7). Defendant cites two cases in support of its position: Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens, 589 F.3d 274 (6th Cir.2009), and Abel v. Keybank USA N.A., 313 F.Supp.2d 720, 727 (N.D.Ohio 2004). These cases, however, cut the other way.\nIn Monroe Retail, several banks were charging service fees for garnishing debtors’ bank accounts, and the banks were deducting those fees directly from the accounts. Id. at 277. According to Plaintiffs, the garnishors, that violated Ohio state law, which requires banks to relinquish the debtors’ funds to the garnishors before deducting service fees. Id. at 280. The Sixth Court noted that 12 C.F.R. § 7.4002(a) grants banks broad authority to “charge [their] customers non-interest charges and fees, including deposit account service charges.” Id. at 281 (quoting 12 C.F.R. § 7.4002(a)). The Sixth Circuit held the Ohio law significantly interferes with a national bank’s power to charge fees because the law “mandates the order in which those banks carry out their daily account-balancing and account-management functions.” Id. at 284.\nMonroe does not resolve the present issue of preemption. The case address any law related to post-repossession collection activities and did not involve the bank’s right to collect a debt. Rather, the law at issue in Monroe involved the right of a different creditor — that is, a creditor other than the bank — to garnish a debtor’s bank account. In fact, the court in Mon*765roe found “that the NBA does not preempt general state debt collection laws, including those regulating both banks’ and others’ rights to collect debts.” Id. at 283.\nDefendant also cites Abel v. Keybank, 313 F.Supp.2d 720 (N.D.Ohio 2004). In Abel, the state law at issue was a provision of RISA that required reading into “each promissory note (arising from a consumer transaction) a requirement that any holder, including a national bank, assume the liability of the seller under certain circumstances.” Id. at 727. The court found that “this type of state imposed liability significantly interferes with a national bank’s ability to negotiate promissory notes and lend money.” Id. This was because the law “essentially requires national banks to become insurers for sellers vis a vis consumers.” Id. In other words, the state law would make a bank liable for actions taken by an original lender, actions over which the bank had no input or control. In this case, by contrast, the law does not make the bank an insurer; the law merely holds a bank liable for its own actions.\nButtressing the Abel court’s conclusion was a preemption clause in the federal regulations — the same regulations at issue in this case. Id. at 728. Those regulations expressly preempt state laws concerning “terms of credit.” 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(d)(4). In the eyes of the Abel court, the state-law provision was one concerning terms of credit. 313 F.Supp.2d at 727-28. The court did not construe the law — indeed did not even consider it — as one related to the right to collect debt. Accordingly, the court’s reasoning and holding does not bear on the preemption question before this Court.\nPlaintiffs here do not seek to hold Defendant liable for any actions by Crestmont during the initial processing of the loan, nor are Plaintiffs seeking to impose additional terms of credit on the contract. Instead, Plaintiffs are seeking to impose liability on Defendant for the actions Defendant took during post-repossession debt-collection activities.\nIn fact, the obstacle preemption argument — that state laws regulating repossession notice requirements significantly interfere with a bank’s lending power and therefore stand as an obstacle to the federal statutory scheme — was persuasively rejected by the court in Aguayo. 653 F.3d at 925. There the court reasoned that, even if the debt-collection laws prevent a bank from recovering a deficiency, it cannot be said to affect the bank’s lending operations. Id. (emphasis in original). Such a provision cannot significantly interfere with the bank’s lending operations because the collection laws at issue come into effect only after the consumer has defaulted on the contract — well after the loan has been made. Id. Thus “[tjhere is no loan at this juncture, but merely an outstanding debt [the bank] has sought to recover using a remedy provided for under state law.” Id. See Epps, 675 F.3d at 326. (“[P]ost default debt collections is distinct from the creditor’s initial determination to extend credit to the debtor. Moreover, under [the bank’s] theory, any state debt collection regulation would burden the exercise of a national bank’s lending power, and all state laws applicable to debt collection would be invalid as applied to such banks.”) (emphasis in original).\nMoreover, a bank cannot, on the one hand, avail itself of the right to repossess a vehicle under state law and then, on the other hand, disclaim the applicability of that very law by arguing it significantly interferes with its ability to engage in the business of banking. See Aguayo, 653 F.3d at 925. A bank may not use state law as both a sword and a shield. In any event, whatever burden the state-law no*766tice requirements can be said to impose on banks is, at worst, de minimis.\nAccordingly, the Court finds that the NBA and the OCC regulations do not preempt the RISA or OUCC provisions at issue in this case.\nD. Alternative Argument\nDefendant next argues that, even if federal law does not preempt RISA, RISA does not apply to Defendant because RISA does not regulate transactions between consumers and financial institutions. It is true that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions, O.R.C. § 1317.01(P), and there is no question Defendant is a financial institution: “a national bank organized and existing as a national bank association.” O.R.C. § 5725.01(A)(1).\nHowever, RISA does apply to three-party transactions — transactions in which “a retailer extends credit to a buyer and takes a security interest in the goods being purchased on credit, and subsequently assigns the note and security interest to a financial institution.” Jones v. Cynet, Inc., Ohio Ct.App. 8th Dist., No. 79769, 2002 WL 1041829 at *3-4 (May 23, 2002) (citing Howard v. SunStar Acceptance Corp. (May 8, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-70, unreported, 2001 WL 481936, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 2039). Accord Huntington National Bank v. Elkins, 43 Ohio App.3d 64, 539 N.E.2d 1135, 1139 (1987) (“[W]here the seller itself has financed the sale and then transferred or assigned the installment note and security agreement to a third party, usually a financial institution____, the applicability of RISA has been generally assumed.”).\nThis case involves a three-party transaction. Crestmont financed the vehicle for Plaintiffs, took a security interest in the vehicle, and then assigned that interest to Defendant. Accordingly, RISA is applicable.\nIV. Breach of Contract\nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim should be dismissed because the contract expressly provides for collection fees. (Doc # : 7 at 18). The contract does not expressly provide for collection fees. The contract does, however, expressly provide for “allowable expenses,” defined as “expenses we pay as a direct result of taking the vehicle, holding it, preparing it for sale and selling it.” (Id.). The term “collection fees” is found nowhere in the contract. Rather, the term is in Defendant’s letter, attached to the Complaint, explaining the calculation of the deficiency amount. (Doc #: 1-2). Among the other items listed in the letter are locator fees, storage fees, impound fees, auction fees, agent fees, repair fees, and transportation fees.\nThe term “collection fees” is ambiguous. Without further fact development, there is no way to determine if “collection fees” refer to the expenses that resulted from taking, holding, preparing for sale, or selling the vehicle, or if they refer to something else. Certainly one interpretation— an interpretation favorable to Plaintiffs — is that these fees have nothing to do with repossessing and selling the car and instead have to do with Defendant’s efforts to collect on the debt, such as through phone calls, letters, and other communications with Plaintiffs. Indeed, any expense Defendant assumed to “collect” the car— that is, to physically repossess the car— would more appropriately be called “transportation fees,” which is a category of expenses listed in Defendant’s deficiency letter.\nEither way, what is meant by “collection fees” is a question that cannot be resolved at the pleading stage; it can only be resolved after discovery has commenced and *767the facts have been developed. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim is denied.\nV. Unjust Enrichment\nIn Ohio, recovery is generally not allowed under a claim for unjust enrichment where there is an express contract that covers the same subject. MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC, 591 F.Supp.2d 944, 964 (N.D.Ohio 2008). A claim for unjust enrichment may proceed, however, even where there is an express contract, if the party against whom the claim is against acted in bad faith. See Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A., C-3-86-561,1992 WL 1258518 (S.D.Ohio Aug. 24, 1992). Plaintiffs argue Defendant acted in bad faith by charging fees when it knew or should have known that such fees are explicitly prohibited under the contract terms and under Ohio law.\n“Bad faith” is “that which imports a dishonest purpose and implies wrongdoing or some motive of self-interest.” Casserlie v. Shell Oil Co., 121 Ohio St.3d 55, 63, 902 N.E.2d 1 (2009) (internal quotation and citation omitted). The bad-faith exception is limited to bad faith in “inducing the party into entering into the contract, or ... in terminating the contract.” Randolph v. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co., 526 F.2d 1383, 1387 (6th Cir.1975).\nThere is no dispute that Cresmont, not Defendant, entered into the contract with Plaintiffs. And, of course, Cresmont is not a party to this action. There is also no dispute that the contract was terminated because Plaintiffs, not Defendant, defaulted on the contract. So the bad-faith exception as limited by Randolph does not fit the alleged facts of this case. Furthermore, even under the broad definition of bad faith Plaintiffs do not have a valid cause of action, for they do not allege any facts that show, directly or indirectly, Defendant had a dishonest purpose. Plaintiffs’ conclusory, unsupported claim must be dismissed.\nVI. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby DENIES IN PART and GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s motion to dismiss (Doc # : 7) and dismisses Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n. See Wells Fargo Dealer Services v. Timothy Reese, et. al., No. CV 11764474, Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Dec. 19, 2011).\n. The court in Aguayo was interpreting California’s Rees-Levering Act, which:\n(1) required disclosure in the conditional sale contract of cash price, fees, taxes, maximum amount of finance charges, and other dealer-added charges (Cal. Civ.Code § 2982(a)); (2) limitations on security interests that may be created by conditional sale contracts (id. § 2984.2); (3) required disclosure of a buyer’s right to prepay a vehi*763cle purchase contract without penalty {id. § 2982{l)); (4) requirements governing the repossession and resale of vehicles by the seller or contract holder {id. §§ 2983.2, 2983.3); and (5) a buyer’s remedies when a seller violates the Act {id. §§ 2982.7, 2983.1, 2983.8(b)).\nAguayo, 653 F.3d at 919. This Act, like RISA, prohibits collection of any deficiency if the seller violates the statutory requirements. See Cal. Civ.Code § 2983.8(b).\n. The court in Epps was interpreting Maryland’s Credit Grantor Closed End Credit Provisions (“CLEC”), which requires that:\n a notice be sent within five days after repossession that includes the borrower's rights to redeem the property, the borrower’s rights as to a resale and liability for a deficiency, and the exact location where the property is stored. [Md.Code Ann., Com. Law], § 12-1021(e). Furthermore, CLEC requires that, ten days before any sale, notice be given by specified means as to the time and place of the sale. Id. § 12-1021(j)(l)(ii). After a sale of repossessed goods, CLEC also requires a full accounting to the borrower which includes: expenses related to the sale; the purchaser’s name, address, and business address; and the number of bids sought and received. Id. § 12 — 1021(j)(2).\nEpps, 675 F.3d at 318. The penalty for failure to abide by these terms was also prohibition on collecting the deficiency. Id."},


#### Summarized version of the same case:

{"input":"Draft a legal argument supporting breach of contract claims against Wells Fargo Bank, NA, highlighting ambiguities in the contract regarding collection fees and the implications for the plaintiffs."'output':"Summary:\nLaneeka White and Timothy Reese bought a car from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio and financed it through a Retail Installment Sales Contract with Cresmont. The contract was later assigned to Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision stating that federal and Ohio law applied. The contract also provided for the sale of the vehicle if the Plaintiffs defaulted and did not pay the required amount.\nPlaintiffs defaulted on the loan in September 2011, and Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle. Wells Fargo sent a Notice of Sale and a Redemption Notice to the Plaintiffs, informing them of the public sale of the vehicle. The sale was eventually held on November 3, 2011, and the vehicle was sold for $9,600, which was less than the minimum bid of $14,850 stated in the Notice of Sale. Wells Fargo applied the sale proceeds to the balance due under the contract, resulting in a deficiency. Wells Fargo then sent a Deficiency Notice to the Plaintiffs, which included collection fees of $1291.21.\nWells Fargo filed a lawsuit against the Plaintiffs in state court to recover the deficiency and the collection fees. However, the case was later voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.\nIn this putative class action, Plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo committed multiple violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC) by failing to disclose the correct date of the public sale, the correct minimum bid, and by charging prohibited fees, among other things. Plaintiffs seek class certification, an order declaring Defendant's acts unlawful, an injunction preventing Defendant from seeking to collect any alleged deficiencies, and other relief.\nDefendants have filed a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' claims. To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\nPlaintiffs' statutory claims are based on RISA and the OUCC, which require creditors to follow specified procedures when repossessing and disposing of consumers' vehicles. Defendant argues that these statutory claims are preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and the implementing regulations promulgated by the Office of Comptroller Currency (OCC).\nThere are three ways federal law may preempt state law: express preemption, field preemption, and obstacle preemption. Express preemption occurs when federal law explicitly states that it preempts state law. Field preemption occurs when Congress has so extensively regulated a given industry that it leaves no room for state regulation. Obstacle preemption occurs when state law functions as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\nDefendant argues that the NBA and OCC regulations fall under all three preemption categories. However, the court found that 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008 does not expressly preempt the repossession notice requirements in either RISA or OUCC. The court also found that RISA and the OUCC are not preempted by virtue of the fact that Congress has extensively regulated in the banking industry, such that there is a presumption that the federal government has occupied the field. The court further found that RISA and the OUCC do not significantly interfere with a bank's exercise of its powers and therefore do not stand as an obstacle to the federal statutory scheme.\nPlaintiffs also allege breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim should be dismissed because the contract expressly provides for collection fees. However, the contract does not expressly provide for collection fees. The contract does, however, expressly provide for *allowable expenses,* which are defined as expenses paid as a direct result of taking the vehicle, holding it, preparing it for sale, and selling it. The term *collection fees* is found nowhere in the contract.\nPlaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim is based on the argument that Defendant acted in bad faith by charging fees when it knew or should have known that such fees are explicitly prohibited under the contract terms and under Ohio law. However, the court found that Plaintiffs do not have a valid cause of action for unjust enrichment because they do not allege any facts that show, directly or indirectly, Defendant had a dishonest purpose.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby DENIES IN PART and GRANTS IN PART Defendant's motion to dismiss and dismisses Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim."},

{'input':"Explain why a breach of contract claim should not be dismissed.",'output':"A breach of contract claim should not be dismissed without sufficient factual development. As the Supreme Court held in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 550 (2007), a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. In other words, the plaintiff must plead factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\nIn the context of a breach of contract claim, this means that the plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to establish the existence of a contract, the defendant's breach of that contract, and damages resulting from the breach. In many cases, the terms of the contract will be dispositive of whether a breach has occurred. However, in cases where the contract is ambiguous or where extrinsic evidence is needed to interpret the contract, the court may need to consider evidence beyond the pleadings.\nMoreover, as the court recognized in Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S. 519, 525 (1977), a breach of contract claim may also be based on the defendant's failure to perform a duty implied by law, even if not expressly stated in the contract. For example, under the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act, O.R.C. § 1317.01 et seq., and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code, O.R.C. § 1309.101 et seq., creditors are required to provide certain notices to debtors in connection with repossession and sale of collateral. Failure to provide these notices may constitute a breach of the creditor's duty and give rise to a claim for damages.\nFurthermore, as the court noted in Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25, 31 (1996), a breach of contract claim may also be based on the defendant's failure to comply with applicable regulations. For example, under the National Banking Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and the implementing regulations promulgated by the Office of Comptroller Currency, 12 C.F.R. § 7.4008(d), national banks are subject to certain limitations on their lending activities. Failure to comply with these regulations may constitute a breach of the bank's contractual obligations to the borrower.\nIn light of these authorities, a breach of contract claim should not be dismissed without sufficient factual development to establish the existence of a contract, the defendant's breach of that contract, and damages resulting from the breach. The court may need to consider evidence beyond the pleadings, including the terms of the contract and any applicable regulations, in order to determine whether a breach has occurred. Additionally, the court may consider whether the defendant has failed to perform a duty implied by law, even if not expressly stated in the contract, in determining whether a breach has occurred."},

# Answers to BS refusals to cooperate with discovery

{'input': "I asked the defendant for discovery of facts, and they claim that suspicious activity report privilege to deny it. How do I fend off their claim?", 'output': "ORDER\nDOUGLAS N. FRAZIER, United States Magistrate Judge.\nThis cause is before the Court on the Plaintiffs, Franz Lesti and Petra Richter’s Motion to Compel Wells Fargo Bank to Produce Information Relating to Co-Conspirator Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs in Response to Plaintiffs’ Document Requests and in Depositions (Doe. 160) filed on February 13, 2014. The Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Supplemental Information Regarding Their Pending Motion to Compel (Doc. 174) attaching an Authorization for Release of Bank Information, Waiver of Protections Under Florida Statute § 655.059, and Request for Books and Records Under Florida Statute § 655.059(2)(A) signed by Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs (“Fuchs”). (Doc. 174-1). The Defendant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) filed a Response (Doc. 185) on March 10, 2014. Wells Fargo also filed a Petition to Quash Subpoena (Doc. 183-2) in the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division requesting that a subpoena served on Wells Fargo in California by Plaintiffs be quashed. The Subpoena requested the same information as requested in the instant Motion to Compel filed in this Court.\nPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26,\nParties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense of any party — including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any documents or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons who know of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). The purpose of discovery is to require disclosure of relevant *667information so that the resolution of the civil action is based upon a full and accurate understanding of the facts. Anglin v. Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc. 2009 WL 928305, *2 (M.D.Fla. April 3, 2009) (citing United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S.Ct. 983, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1958)). When the discovery requested appears relevant on its face, then the party objecting to the discovery based upon relevance has the burden to show the requested discovery is not relevant. Unlimited Resources, Inc. v. Deployed Resources, LLC, 2009 WL 212188 at *3 (M.D.Fla. Jan. 29, 2009). The scope of discovery is broad, however, the information must be relevant to a claim or defense, but need not be admissible at trial. Anglin, 2009 WL 928305 at *2 (citations omitted).\nRequest for Production No. 7 provides as follows:\nAll documents pertaining to Angelika Neumeier a/k/a Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs.\nWells Fargo1 initially objected asserting that the Request was overly broad and unduly burdensome as written; the Request seeks documents that are irrelevant and immaterial to the claims and defenses raised in this action; and the Request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Wells Fargo also raises the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product doctrine. Wells Fargo then states that “[b]y agreement of the parties, a privilege log will be produced at a later date and time insofar as the documents not being produced on the basis of attorney-client privilege and/or the work-produet doctrine, upon the completion and review of the electronic data searches to be conducted by Wells Fargo once the parties reach an agreement as to the electronic search parameters.” (Doc. 160, p. 4). Wells Fargo also asserts that it will not produce the documents which are exempt from disclosure pursuant to applicable law. Wells Fargo argues that this case involved one single cheeking account and a single money market account, both of which were closed a few months after being opened, and Wells Fargo only provided routine banking services to PCOM. Wells Fargo argues that the Plaintiffs could have taken discovery directly from Fuchs but did not. Wells Fargo also raises the Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) Privilege.\nThe Plaintiffs respond that they are seeking documents relating to Wells Fargo’s conduct in opening accounts for Fuchs, the sole officer of PCOM. The Plaintiffs claim that after Wells Fargo learned of the money-laundering in the PCOM accounts and decided to close those accounts, it allowed Fuchs to transfer allegedly $1 million from PCOM accounts into her own accounts. The Plaintiffs are attempting to obtain documentation as to the financial transactions involved in Fuchs’ accounts to determine if the proceeds of illegal activity were involved.\nAddressing the SAR privilege first, the Court previously stated that the SAR privilege protects against disclosure of “[a] SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR[.]” 12 C.F.R. § 21.11(k). However, “supporting documentation” giving rise to a SAR that is generated or received in the ordinary course of business is discoverable. Union Bank of California v. Superior Court, 130 Cal.App.4th 378, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 894, 901 (2005). “Thus, transactional and account documents such as wire transfers, statements, check and deposit slips are the types of documents generated in the ordinary course of business that are subject to discovery [citation omitted]. Such documents would be prepared regardless of whether a financial institution has an obligation to report suspicious activity to the federal government.” Id. The Court followed Cotton v. PrivateBank & Trust Co., 235 F.Supp.2d 809, 815 (N.D.Ill.2002) which found as follows:\nThere are two types of supporting documents. The first category represents the factual documents which give rise to suspicious conduct. These are to be produced in the ordinary course of discovery because they are business records made in the ordinary course of business. The second category is documents representing drafts of SARs or other work product or privi*668leged communications that relate to the SAR itself. These are not to be produced because they would disclose whether a SAR has been prepared or filed.\nId.\nThis Court also followed the reasoning in Regions Bank v. Allen, 33 So.3d 72, 76-77 (Fla. 5th DCA 2010). The court in Regions Bank found that\na draft SAR or internal memorandum prepared as part of a financial institution’s process for complying with federal reporting requirements is generated for the specific purpose of fulfilling the institution’s reporting obligation. These types of documents fall within the scope of the SAR privilege because they may reveal the contents of a SAR and disclose whether a SAR has been prepared or filed. Unlike transactional documents, which are evidence of suspicious conduct, draft SAR’s and other internal memoranda or forms that are part of the process of filing SAR’s are created to report suspicious conduct.\nId., quoting 12 C.F.R. § 21.1(k) (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also, Union Bank of California v. Superior Court, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d at 902.\nThe Court determines that account information for Fuchs is relevant and appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Court will limit Request No. 7, to factual documents which may or may not give rise to suspicious conduct. If transfers occurred between the PCOM account and Fuchs’ personal accounts, then that information may be relevant, and appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as to the claim of aiding and abetting. Although the Plaintiffs attempt to extend the meaning of Request No. 72, the Court will limit it to factual documents to avoid any conflict with the SAR privilege. The Court will require Wells Fargo to produce all business records made in the ordinary course of business, in its possession, custody or control relating to Fuchs’ accounts including, but not limited to, correspondence, e-mails, facsimiles, account statements, wire transfer records, cancelled checks, deposit slips, and other documents of these types related to Fuchs’ accounts only. Wells Fargo shall not produce documents representing drafts of SARs or other work product or privileged communications that relate to the SAR itself or internal memorandum prepared as part of a financial institution’s process for complying with federal reporting requirements. If the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine applies, then Wells Fargo must produce a privilege log.\nThe Plaintiffs also request that the Court require Wells Fargo to provide answers to questions that occurred in depositions regarding Fuchs’ accounts and activities, and direct Wells Fargo in the future not to instruct witnesses not to answer questions based on customer confidentiality. When the depositions occurred, Wells Fargo properly invoked Fla. Stat. § 655.059 to protect Fuchs’ and other non-parties’ confidential banking information. The Plaintiffs obtained Fuchs’ waiver after the depositions were completed. The Court will not require Wells Fargo to provide answers now that a waiver has been signed by Fuchs, nor will it prohibit Wells Fargo from instructing its witnesses as it sees fit.\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n1) The Motion to Compel Wells Fargo Bank to Produce Information Relating to Co-Conspirator Angelika NeumeierFuchs in Response to Plaintiffs’ Document Requests and in Depositions (Doc. 160) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.\n2) The Motion to Compel is GRANTED to the extent that Wells Fargo shall produce the documents as listed above and a privilege log, if necessary, within twenty-one (21) days from the date of this Order.\n*6693) The Motion to Compel is DENIED in all other respects. The Court will not award sanctions or fees.\n. With the filing of the Authorization for Release of Bank Information, Wells Fargo did not confinue to assert that the information was privileged pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 655.059.\n. In the Notice of Supplemental Information (Doc. 174), the Plaintiffs attempt to expand Request No. 7 to include, “all relevant policies, procedures and internal bank documents regarding ‘related accounts.' ” (Doc. 174, p. 2). This information is beyond the scope of Request No. 7, and therefore, the Court will not extend Request No. 7 beyond its plain language."},

Wells Fargo also raises the Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) Privilege.\nThe Plaintiffs respond that they are seeking documents relating to Wells Fargo’s conduct in opening accounts for Fuchs, the sole officer of PCOM. The Plaintiffs claim that after Wells Fargo learned of the money-laundering in the PCOM accounts and decided to close those accounts, it allowed Fuchs to transfer allegedly $1 million from PCOM accounts into her own accounts. The Plaintiffs are attempting to obtain documentation as to the financial transactions involved in Fuchs’ accounts to determine if the proceeds of illegal activity were involved.\nAddressing the SAR privilege first, the Court previously stated that the SAR privilege protects against disclosure of “[a] SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR[.]” 12 C.F.R. § 21.11(k). However, “supporting documentation” giving rise to a SAR that is generated or received in the ordinary course of business is discoverable. Union Bank of California v. Superior Court, 130 Cal.App.4th 378, 29 Cal. Rptr.3d 894, 901 (2005). “Thus, transactional and account documents such as wire transfers, statements, check and deposit slips are the types of documents generated in the ordinary course of business that are subject to discovery [citation omitted]. Such documents would be prepared regardless of whether a financial institution has an obligation to report suspicious activity to the federal government.” Id. The Court followed Cotton v. PrivateBank & Trust Co., 235 F.Supp.2d 809, 815 (N.D.Ill.2002) which found as follows:\nThere are two types of supporting documents. The first category represents the factual documents which give rise to suspicious conduct. These are to be produced in the ordinary course of discovery because they are business records made in the ordinary course of business. The second category is documents representing drafts of SARs or other work product or privi*668leged communications that relate to the SAR itself. These are not to be produced because they would disclose whether a SAR has been prepared or filed.\nId.\nThis Court also followed the reasoning in Regions Bank v. Allen, 33 So.3d 72, 76-77 (Fla. 5th DCA 2010). The court in Regions Bank found that\na draft SAR or internal memorandum prepared as part of a financial institution’s process for complying with federal reporting requirements is generated for the specific purpose of fulfilling the institution’s reporting obligation. These types of documents fall within the scope of the SAR privilege because they may reveal the contents of a SAR and disclose whether a SAR has been prepared or filed. Unlike transactional documents, which are evidence of suspicious conduct, draft SAR’s and other internal memoranda or forms that are part of the process of filing SAR’s are created to report suspicious conduct.\nId., quoting 12 C.F.R. § 21.1(k) (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also, Union Bank of California v. Superior Court, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d at 902.\nThe Court determines that account information for Fuchs is relevant and appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Court will limit Request No. 7, to factual documents which may or may not give rise to suspicious conduct. If transfers occurred between the PCOM account and Fuchs’ personal accounts, then that information may be relevant, and appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as to the claim of aiding and abetting. Although the Plaintiffs attempt to extend the meaning of Request No. 72, the Court will limit it to factual documents to avoid any conflict with the SAR privilege. The Court will require Wells Fargo to produce all business records made in the ordinary course of business, in its possession, custody or control relating to Fuchs’ accounts including, but not limited to, correspondence, e-mails, facsimiles, account statements, wire transfer records, cancelled checks, deposit slips, and other documents of these types related to Fuchs’ accounts only. Wells Fargo shall not produce documents representing drafts of SARs or other work product or privileged communications that relate to the SAR itself or internal memorandum prepared as part of a financial institution’s process for complying with federal reporting requirements. If the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine applies, then Wells Fargo must produce a privilege log.\nThe Plaintiffs also request that the Court require Wells Fargo to provide answers to questions that occurred in depositions regarding Fuchs’ accounts and activities, and direct Wells Fargo in the future not to instruct witnesses not to answer questions based on customer confidentiality. When the depositions occurred, Wells Fargo properly invoked Fla. Stat. § 655.059 to protect Fuchs’ and other non-parties’ confidential banking information. The Plaintiffs obtained Fuchs’ waiver after the depositions were completed. The Court will not require Wells Fargo to provide answers now that a waiver has been signed by Fuchs, nor will it prohibit Wells Fargo from instructing its witnesses as it sees fit.\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n1) The Motion to Compel Wells Fargo Bank to Produce Information Relating to Co-Conspirator Angelika NeumeierFuchs in Response to Plaintiffs’ Document Requests and in Depositions (Doc. 160) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.\n2) The Motion to Compel is GRANTED to the extent that Wells Fargo shall produce the documents as listed above and a privilege log, if necessary, within twenty-one (21) days from the date of this Order.\n*6693) The Motion to Compel is DENIED in all other respects. The Court will not award sanctions or fees.\n. With the filing of the Authorization for Release of Bank Information, Wells Fargo did not confinue to assert that the information was privileged pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 655.059.\n. In the Notice of Supplemental Information (Doc. 174), the Plaintiffs attempt to expand Request No. 7 to include, “all relevant policies, procedures and internal bank documents regarding ‘related accounts.' ” (Doc. 174, p. 2). This information is beyond the scope of Request No. 7, and therefore, the Court will not extend Request No. 7 beyond its plain language."},

FRAZIER, United States Magistrate Judge.\nThis cause is before the Court on the Plaintiffs, Franz Lesti and Petra Richter’s Motion to Compel Wells Fargo Bank to Produce Information Relating to Co-Conspirator Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs in Response to Plaintiffs’ Document Requests and in Depositions (Doe. 160) filed on February 13, 2014. The Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Supplemental Information Regarding Their Pending Motion to Compel (Doc. 174) attaching an Authorization for Release of Bank Information, Waiver of Protections Under Florida Statute § 655.059, and Request for Books and Records Under Florida Statute § 655.059(2)(A) signed by Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs (“Fuchs”). (Doc. 174-1). The Defendant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) filed a Response (Doc. 185) on March 10, 2014. Wells Fargo also filed a Petition to Quash Subpoena (Doc. 183-2) in the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division requesting that a subpoena served on Wells Fargo in California by Plaintiffs be quashed. The Subpoena requested the same information as requested in the instant Motion to Compel filed in this Court.\nPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26,\nParties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense of any party — including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any documents or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons who know of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). The purpose of discovery is to require disclosure of relevant *667information so that the resolution of the civil action is based upon a full and accurate understanding of the facts. Anglin v. Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc. 2009 WL 928305, *2 (M.D.Fla. April 3, 2009) (citing United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S.Ct. 983, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1958)). When the discovery requested appears relevant on its face, then the party objecting to the discovery based upon relevance has the burden to show the requested discovery is not relevant. Unlimited Resources, Inc. v. Deployed Resources, LLC, 2009 WL 212188 at *3 (M.D.Fla. Jan. 29, 2009). The scope of discovery is broad, however, the information must be relevant to a claim or defense, but need not be admissible at trial. Anglin, 2009 WL 928305 at *2 (citations omitted).\nRequest for Production No. 7 provides as follows:\nAll documents pertaining to Angelika Neumeier a/k/a Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs.\nWells Fargo1 initially objected asserting that the Request was overly broad and unduly burdensome as written; the Request seeks documents that are irrelevant and immaterial to the claims and defenses raised in this action; and the Request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Wells Fargo also raises the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product doctrine. Wells Fargo then states that “[b]y agreement of the parties, a privilege log will be produced at a later date and time insofar as the documents not being produced on the basis of attorney-client privilege and/or the work-produet doctrine, upon the completion and review of the electronic data searches to be conducted by Wells Fargo once the parties reach an agreement as to the electronic search parameters.” (Doc. 160, p. 4). Wells Fargo also asserts that it will not produce the documents which are exempt from disclosure pursuant to applicable law. Wells Fargo argues that this case involved one single cheeking account and a single money market account, both of which were closed a few months after being opened, and Wells Fargo only provided routine banking services to PCOM.

Massachusetts, Central Division.\nSeptember 29, 2010.\n*724 Michael J. Tremblay, Law Office of Michael J. Tremblay, Marlborough, MA, for Plaintiff.\nMEMORANDUM OF DECISION\nHENRY J. BOROFF, Bankruptcy Judge.\nBefore the Court is a motion filed by defendant Wells Fargo Bank, NA (*Wells Fargo*) to dismiss the adversary complaint brought by plaintiff Carmen M. Bailey (the *Debtor*). Through this adversary proceeding, the Debtor seeks to invalidate Wells Fargo's prepetition foreclosure sale of the Debtor's residence on the grounds that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage at the time of its foreclosure. For the reasons set forth below, including that Wells Fargo's request for dismissal is grounded largely in documents extraneous to the complaint, the Court is able to dismiss some, but not all of the counts of the Debtor's complaint.\nI. FACTS AND TRAVEL OF THE CASE\nIn 1992, the Debtor obtained a $104,000 mortgage loan (the *Mortgage*) from Shawmut Mortgage Company (*Shawmut*) to purchase her residence in Hudson, Massachusetts (the *Property*).[1] In late November 2008, the Debtor fell behind on her mortgage payments, and on August 26, 2009, Wells Fargo, representing itself as the then-current holder of the Mortgage, filed a petition under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act with the Land Court Department of the Massachusetts Trial Court (the *Land Court*) in order to clear the path to a foreclosure of the Property.[2] On October 23, 2009, Wells Fargo conducted a foreclosure sale and the Property was sold to a third-party buyer (the *Foreclosure*). Shortly thereafter, on November 9, 2009, the Debtor filed a petition for relief under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.[3]\nOn November 23, 2009, the Debtor filed an adversary proceeding against Wells Fargo, seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Foreclosure was invalid because Wells Fargo was and is not the true holder of the note and Mortgage.[4]*725 Wells Fargo has filed a motion to dismiss (the *Motion to Dismiss*), to which the Debtor objects. After a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the Court took the matter under advisement and gave the parties additional time to file supplemental briefs, which both the Debtor and Wells Fargo have done.\nII. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES/nIn her five-count complaint (the *Complaint*), the Debtor seeks: a declaratory judgment that the Foreclosure was invalid (Count I); damages for *Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing* (Count II); damages for *Infliction of Emotional Distress* (Count III); damages for Wells Fargo's *Unjust Enrichment* (Count IV); and damages for Wells Fargo's purported violations of the Massachusetts consumer protection statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (*Chapter 93A*) (Count V).\nA. Count I: Declaratory Judgment\n1. Mortgage-Holder Status\nThe central theme of the Debtor's Complaint is the invalidity of the Foreclosure based on Wells Fargo's failure to demonstrate that it was the holder of the Mortgage at the time of the Foreclosure. According to the Debtor, the only recorded documents indexed under the Debtor's name at the registry of deeds (the *Registry*) are the Mortgage to Shawmut and an assignment of the Mortgage from Washington Mutual Bank (*Washington Mutual*) to Wells Fargo (the *Assignment*). This gap in the chain of record titlethe lack of evidence on record showing a transfer of the Mortgage from Shawmut to Washington Mutualinvalidates the Foreclosure under the Debtor's reading of the Land Court's decision in U.S. Bank National Ass'n v. Ibanez, Nos. 08 Misc. 384283(KCL), 08 Misc. 386755(KCL), 2009 WL 3297551 (Mass.Land Ct. Oct. 14, 2009) (*Ibanez II*),[5] and the Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court's decision in In re Schwartz, 366 B.R. 265 (Bankr.D.Mass. 2007). According to the Debtor, under Ibanez II and Schwartz, a foreclosing party must demonstrate its status as holder of the mortgage as of record at the relevant registry of deeds or the foreclosure may be declared invalid.\nIn its Motion to Dismiss, Wells Fargo says the Mortgage was validly transferred from Shawmut to Washington Mutual through a series of off-record mergers and name changes, and attached several exhibits to the Motion to Dismiss in support of this contention. Although these documents are not recorded at the Registry, Wells Fargo argues that recording is not required under Massachusetts law. Contrary to the Debtor's reading of Ibanez II, Wells Fargo says the court in the Ibanez cases, see supra note 5, did not hold that record title must be *perfect* in order to conduct a valid foreclosure sale. Rather, Wells Fargo reads the Ibanez decisions simply as holding that a purported mortgage-holder must actually hold the mortgage at the time notice of the Foreclosure is published, but may wait to record the documents evidencing its holder status until after the foreclosure sale is completed. Because, according to Wells Fargo, the exhibits attached to the Motion to Dismiss demonstrate an unbroken chain of title from Shawmut to Wells Fargo, the Foreclosure *726 was valid under Massachusetts law.\nBut the Debtor additionally argues that even these off-record documents do not establish that Wells Fargo was actually the holder of the Mortgage at the time of the Foreclosure. Indeed, the Debtor maintains that additional off-record documents *demonstrate that the[ ] asserted events did not all actually take place.* Pl.'s Reply Mem. Opp. to Def.'s M. to Dismiss, at 3, May 4, 2010, ECF No. 41. The Debtor says that, at the very least, Wells Fargo has not shown how title to the Mortgage passed between certain entities connected to a limited partnership, and further notes that an anomalous assignment from Fleet Mortgage Corp. to Fleet Mortgage Corp., signed and notarized on different dates, is not explained. Therefore, according to the Debtor, Wells Fargo's Motion to Dismiss should be denied in favor of further developing the evidentiary record.\n2. Notice\nAs a second ground for invalidating the Foreclosure, the Debtor says that Wells Fargo failed to provide the Debtor with the statutorily-required notice of the Foreclosure. In its Motion to Dismiss, however, Wells Fargo argues that it did provide the appropriate notice, and has attached copies of Notices of Sale with certified mail stamps to demonstrate that the appropriate notices were sent to the Debtor by both first class and certified mail. Wells Fargo says this is all that was required under Massachusetts law the foreclosing party need only prove that the appropriate notice was sent; proof of actual receipt is not required.\nIn response, the Debtor does not challenge Wells Fargo's contention that the notice was sent via certified mail, but says instead that the postal carrier left the notice of certified mail at a seldom-used entrance to her home. According to the Debtor, several days after the Foreclosure had been conducted, she found the notice of certified mail among the leaves near the entrance. Because she did not receive the notices prior to the Foreclosure, the Debtor says the Foreclosure sale should be declared void.\nB. Remaining Counts\nIn addition to the request for Declaratory Judgment, the Debtor seeks damages under various legal theories, each of which depend, in part, on a finding that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the Mortgage at the time of the Foreclosure. In Count II, the Debtor says that Wells Fargo *acted carelessly and recklessly in preserving the custody of important [documents],* Compl. ¶ 39, Nov. 23, 2009, ECF No. 1, and *made false and erroneous assertions of assignment and corporate succession on the record title,* Compl. ¶ 39, and thus impaired the value of the Property and caused the Debtor monetary harm. These actions, the Debtor says, constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing for which the Debtor is entitled to damages.\nIn Count III, the Debtor claims that Wells Fargo's actions were *extreme and outrageous, and beyond the bounds of decency in a civilized society,* Compl. ¶ 44, which Wells Fargo *knew or should have known ... were likely to cause extreme emotional distress to the [Debtor].* Compl. ¶ 44. Thus, the Debtor maintains, Wells Fargo is also liable for the tort of *Infliction of Emotional Distress.* In Count IV, the Debtor contends that Wells Fargo was unjustly enriched when it took mortgage payments from the Debtor without properly holding the Mortgage. And finally, in Count V, the Debtor says that all these actions constitute violations of Chapter 93A. Wells Fargo does not directly refute any of these contentions, relying instead on its assertion that it is and was *727 the holder of the Mortgage at the time of the Foreclosure.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. Motion to Dismiss Standard\nIn considering a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), made applicable to this proceeding by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012, *a court must take the allegations in the complaint as true and must make all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs,* Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993), to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged *sufficient facts to show that he has a plausible entitlement to relief.* Sanchez v. Pereira-Castillo, 590 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir.2009) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)). Furthermore, the court *is generally limited to considering `facts and documents that are part of or incorporated into the complaint.'* Giragosian v. Ryan, 547 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting Trans-Spec Truck Serv., Inc. v. Caterpillar Inc., 524 F.3d 315, 321 (1st Cir.2008)); see also Watterson, 987 F.2d at 3.\nA court may also consider a limited universe of materials not included in or attached to the complaint, such as *documents incorporated by reference in [the complaint], matters of public record, and other matters susceptible to judicial notice.* Giragosian, 547 F.3d at 65 (quoting Banco Santander de P.R. v. Lopez-Stubbe (In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp.), 324 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir.2003)). In some circumstances, the court can also consider *documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties.* Watterson, 987 F.2d at 3.\nHowever, if none of these narrow exceptions applies, and the court relies on materials extraneous to the complaint, *it must convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.* Giragosian, 547 F.3d at 65. Conversion to summary judgment, however, requires that the court give the parties a *reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion.* Clorox Co. P.R. v. Proctor & Gamble Commercial Co., 228 F.3d 24, 31 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)). Although in some instances the First Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the propriety of conversion is guided by a *functional* analysis and has upheld summary judgment rulings where the parties received no formal notice of conversion, such *sub silentio conversion into a motion for summary judgment* is not a practice that receives the First Circuit's general endorsement. Rivera v. Centro Medico de Turabo, Inc., 575 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.2009). Of course, the court can decline to consider any materials not included in or attached to the complaint and decide the motion to dismiss without converting the motion to one for summary judgment. See Garita Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed. Bank, F.S.B., 958 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1992). \nHere, Wells Fargo's Motion to Dismiss is wholly predicated on exhibits extrinsic to the Complaint.[6] Thus, the Court *728 must decide whether to (1) disregard the extraneous materials; (2) consider the documents in the context of the Motion to Dismiss; or (3) consider the documents and convert the motion to one for summary judgment. The Court rejects the option of treating the Motion to Dismiss as one for summary judgment. Not only was no formal notice provided to the parties, but the Court questions the propriety of conversion where, as here, the exhibits are largely in inadmissable form and without an accompanying affidavit.\nThe Court also declines to consider the exhibits within the context of the Motion to Dismiss. While matters of public record may be considered on a motion to dismiss, and while the Debtor has not directly challenged the authenticity of the documents attached to Wells Fargo's Motion to Dismiss, the Debtor argues both that additional documents are necessary to prove Wells Fargo's holder status and that the documents provided, especially the anomalous assignment from Fleet Mortgage Corp. to itself, show that Wells Fargo's narrative of relevant events is incomplete. Because the Debtor raises these challenges, the Court believes *the wiser course is to defer consideration of a summary disposition until the parties have placed before the Court a complete [record]* in order to avoid *invit[ing] a procedural challenge.* Knowlton v. Shaw, 708 F. Supp. 2d 69, 74 (D.Me.2010). Under the circumstances, the better course is to await a ruling after trial or on a summary judgment motion. Knowlton, 708 F.Supp.2d at 74, 76.\nB. Count I: Declaratory Judgment\n1. Record Title\nAlthough the Court has just intimated its intention to deny the Motion to Dismiss as to Count I for declaratory relief, the Court finds it necessary to briefly narrow those issues remaining for summary judgment or trial. Absent the materials attached to the Motion to Dismiss, the Complaint and accompanying exhibits are sufficient to state a claim for declaratory relief on the grounds that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the Mortgage at the time of the Foreclosure. Accepting the Debtor's asserted facts as true, there is a gap in the succession of title to the Mortgage from Shawmut to Wells Fargo's assignor, Washington Mutual. However, the Court agrees with Wells Fargo that the Debtor's reading of the Ibanez cases goes too far. The Debtor interprets the Ibanez II holding as requiring a *pristine* title record in order to validly conduct a foreclosure proceeding. But the Land Court made clear in Ibanez I that the foreclosures invalidated in that case were invalidated because the foreclosing lenders were not the actual holders of the mortgages until some time after publication of the foreclosure notices and completion of the foreclosure sales. Ibanez I, 2009 WL 795201, *8. Where the assignment to the foreclosing lender was executed prior to *729 publication and foreclosure, but not recorded until nearly a year after the conclusion of the foreclosure sale, the Court did not find that the foreclosure was invalid under Massachusetts law. Id. Instead, in Ibanez I, the court, interpreting Mass.G.L. ch. 244, § 14, held that the foreclosure in that instance *was not rendered invalid by [the lender's] failure to record the assignment reflecting its status as the holder of the mortgage prior to the foreclosure since it was, in fact, the holder by assignment at the time of the foreclosure, it truthfully claimed that status in the notice, and it could have produced proof of that status (the unrecorded assignment) if asked.* Id.[7]\nBut the Debtor does not argue only that the record was incomplete, but also that Wells Fargo was not actually the holder of the Mortgage at the time of the Foreclosure. That is the issue which the Court must determine in Count I, and the Debtor has adequately pled sufficient facts to demonstrate that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the Mortgage at the time of the Foreclosure. Therefore, the Court must deny the Motion to Dismiss as to Count I.\n2. Notice\nBecause the Court has declined to consider the materials attached to the Motion to Dismiss, Wells Fargo's offer of documentation to demonstrate that notice of the Foreclosure was sent to the Debtor cannot be considered here. Thus, Wells Fargo's proof must await further consideration on summary judgment or at trial.\nC. Count II: Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\nAs the Massachusetts Court of Appeals has recently explained, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is a contractual concept it is a duty implied by law upon contracting parties preventing either party from *do[ing] anything that will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract....* Targus Grp. Int'l, Inc. v. Sherman, 76 Mass.App. Ct. 421, 922 N.E.2d 841, 853 (2010) (quoting Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs., 411 Mass. 451, 583 N.E.2d 806, 820 (1991); Druker v. Roland Wm. Jutras Assocs., Inc., 370 Mass. 383, 348 N.E.2d 763, 765 (1976)).\nBecause the underlying premise of the Debtor's Complaint is that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the underlying Mortgage contract, this claim tangles the Debtor in a logical paradox. If Wells Fargo was not the holder of the Mortgage, as the Debtor argues, then there is no contract upon which to base the Debtor's claim that Wells Fargo breached the contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. And if Wells Fargo was the holder of the Mortgage at the time of the Foreclosure, then the Debtor's central claim fails and there is no wrongdoing upon which to base a claim for breach of good faith and fair dealing.\nEven if the Court were to ignore the absence of an underlying contract, and even assuming Wells Fargo was not the holder of the Mortgage at the time of the Foreclosure, the Debtor fails to allege facts from which the Court could find *more than a simple breach.* [8]Targus *730 Group, 922 N.E.2d at 853. *Usually, a breach of the implied covenant involves `bad faith' conduct `implicating a dishonest purpose, consciousness of wrong, or ill will in the nature of the fraud.* Id. (quoting Equip. & Sys. for Indus. Inc. v. Northmeadows Constr. Co., 59 Mass.App.Ct. 931, 798 N.E.2d 571, 575 (2003)) (citing Boston Pilots v. Motor Vessel Midnight Gambler & E. Coast Excursions, Inc., 357 F.3d 129, 135 (1st Cir.2004); Christensen v. Kingston Sch. Comm., 360 F. Supp. 2d 212, 226 (D.Mass.2005)). The Debtor has alleged no facts from which such bad faith, dishonest purpose, consciousness of wrong, or ill will can be implied. For these reasons, the Motion to Dismiss must be granted as to Count II of the Complaint.\nD. Count III: Infliction of Emotional Distress\nThe Complaint does not clarify whether the Debtor's infliction of emotional distress claim is one for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, and the Court addresses each. To sustain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must establish *(1) that the actor intended to inflict emotional distress or that he knew or should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of his conduct; (2) that the conduct was extreme and outrageous, was beyond all possible bounds of decency and was utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) that the actions of the defendant were the cause of the plaintiff's distress; and (4) that the emotional distress sustained by the plaintiff was severe and of a nature that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.* Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., 371 Mass. 140, 355 N.E.2d 315, 318-19 (1976) (citations omitted).\nHere, any claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress fails, as a matter of law, because even if Wells Fargo conducted the Foreclosure absent actual authority to do so, and even if the Debtor did suffer *extreme emotional distress,* the facts pled in the Complaint simply cannot support a finding that Wells Fargo's conduct was intentional. At most, Wells Fargo acted negligently if it conducted the Foreclosure without adequate evidence of its status as holder of the Mortgage. And negligence alone will not support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Tetrault v. Mahoney, Hawkes & Goldings, 425 Mass. 456, 681 N.E.2d 1189, 1197 (1997).\nNor does the Complaint adequately state a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. *[I]n order to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress [under Massachusetts law, the plaintiff] must prove the following: (1) negligence; (2) emotional distress; (3) causation; (4) physical harm manifested by objective symptomatology; and (5) that a reasonable person would have suffered emotional distress under the circumstances of the case.* Payton v. Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540, 437 N.E.2d 171, 181 (1982) (emphasis supplied). The Debtor has not alleged any physical harm, and has therefore failed to plead a sufficient claim for relief for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, Count III must be dismissed.\nE. Count IV: Unjust Enrichment\nA claim for unjust enrichment is grounded in the principle that *[a] person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other.* Nat'l Shawmut Bank of Boston v. Fidelity Mut. Life Ins. Co., 318 Mass. 142, 61 N.E.2d 18, 20 (1945) (quoting Restatement: Restitution, § 1) (emphasis supplied); *[a] common instance in which restitution is ordered is where money is paid under a mistake of fact, *731 commonly ... under a mutual mistake of fact." Id. "The fundamental question ... is whether the defendant has received money which in equity and good conscience belongs to the plaintiff.* Id. at 22 (emphasis supplied).\nThe Debtor's unjust enrichment claim fails because the Debtor is not the party aggrieved under an unjust enrichment analysis even if Wells Fargo was not the holder of the Mortgage when the Debtor made mortgage payments to Wells Fargo. If another entity was actually the mortgagee at the time the Debtor made the payments to Wells Fargo, then that entity may have a claim for unjust enrichment. But the Debtor was obligated, under the note and Mortgage, to make her mortgage payments to someone, and would be unjustly enriched herself if those payments were returned. Accordingly, Count IV must be dismissed.\nF. Count V: Chapter 93A\nThe Debtor fails to raise any facts or provide legal support for her contention that Wells Fargo's actions constituted unfair and deceptive acts or practices within the meaning of Chapter 93A § 2. Nor has she presented any facts in support of the allegation that Wells Fargo acted willfully or knowingly within the meaning of that statute. Therefore, Count V must be dismissed.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nBecause the Debtor has adequately pled a claim for declaratory relief, the Motion to Dismiss will be denied as to Count I. The Complaint fails, however, to adequately plead facts in support of the remaining Counts, and the Motion to Dismiss will be granted as to Counts II-V. An order in conformity with this memorandum shall issue forthwith.\nNOTES\n[1] The Property was originally purchased in 1984 by the Debtor and her former husband. The 1992 Mortgage was incurred by the Debtor to purchase her former husband's interest in the Property pursuant to a judgment of divorce and modification agreement.\n[2] The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50 U.S.C.App. §§ 501-591, prevents the foreclosure of a mortgage where the owner of the property is an armed servicemember and the mortgage was entered into prior to the start of military service. See 28 Mass. Prac. § 10.4. In Massachusetts, a special legislative act created a *a court procedure to determine that no one interested in the property is in the military service.* Id. Although bringing an action to obtain that determination is not a prerequisite to a valid foreclosure in the case of non-military owners, most mortgagees do bring such actions prior to foreclosure in order to avoid "chilling" a sale. Otherwise, the *mortgagee forecloses at its peril in proceeding without a court determination of military service. If an owner was in the military service at the time of a foreclosure, a sale is invalid.* Id. at n. 2 (citing John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Lester, 234 Mass. 559, 125 N.E. 594, 595 (1920)).\n[3] See 11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.\n[4] The Debtor also sought a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction to prevent Wells Fargo from delivering or recording the foreclosure deed. Although the Court declined to enter either a restraining order or injunction, the foreclosure deed has apparently not been recorded. See *[Debtor's] Opposition to Objection to Confirmation by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.* at 3, In re Bailey, Chapter 13 Case No. 09-44760 (Bankr. D.Mass. Aug.3, 2010), ECF No. 58.\n[5] In Ibanez II, the Land Court detailed its reasons for denying reconsideration of its decision in U.S. Bank National Ass'n v. Ibanez, Nos. 384283(KCL), 386018(KCL), 386755(KCL), 2009 WL 795201 (Mass.Land Ct. March 26, 2009) (*Ibanez I*).\n[6] The materials attached to the Motion to Dismiss include: (1) the Deed from the Debtor and her former spouse to the Debtor (Exhibit A); (2) Articles of Merger or Share Exchange from the South Carolina Secretary of State's office and *Agreement and Plan of Merger* related to the merger of *Shawmut Mortgage Company* and *Fleet Mortgage Corp.* (Exhibit B); (3) *Assignment of Mortgage* from *Fleet Mortgage Corp. successor by merger to Shawmut Mortgage Company* to *Fleet Mortgage Corp.* dated May 31, 1996 and notarized February 19, 1997 (Exhibit C); (4) Articles of Merger or Share Exchange from the South Carolina Secretary of State's office and *Agreement and Plan of Merger* related to the merger of *Washington Mutual Home Loans, Inc.* and *Fleet Mortgage Corp.* (Exhibit D); (5) Secretary's Certificate signed by William L. Lynch as Secretary of *Washington Mutual Bank, FA* and copies of documents filed with the Ohio Secretary of State's office describing the creation, merger, and dissolution of *WMHLI Transfer Interim LP* and *Washington Mutual Home Loans, Inc.* (Exhibit E); (6) Order from the Massachusetts Land Court dated June 28, 2002 ordering that *all assets ... standing in the name of Washington Mutual Home Loans, Inc. be deemed assigned to and stand in the name of Washington Mutual Bank, FA, effective as of March 1, 2002....* (Exhibit F); (7) Name Change Certification stating that, as of April 4, 2005, *Washington Mutual Bank, FA* changed its corporate name to *Washington Mutual Bank.* (Exhibit G); (8) Assignment from Washington Mutual Bank to Wells Fargo (Exhibit H); (9) Copies from the United States Postal Service website entitled *Track & Confirm* and copies of Notices of Mortgage Foreclosure Sale and Notices of Intention to Foreclose Mortgage (Exhibit I).\n[7] The court in Schwartz reached the same conclusion. There, the court found fault with the fact that, in the case before it, the assignment of the mortgage to the foreclosing party was dated after the foreclosure sale. But the court also stated its agreement with the foreclosing bank's argument that *[t]here is no requirement that an assignment be recorded prior to the foreclosure,* 366 B.R. at 269 (citing Lamson v. Abrams, 305 Mass. 238, 25 N.E.2d 374, 376-77 (1940)).\n[8] Again, the Court is forced to ask, breach of what?"},

## Topic Blake v Wells Fargo, the bank prevailed here, but for cases where the bank retaliates with similar arguments, this is being included : Defenses to allegations of fraud, deliberate wrongdoing, kickbacks or aiding and abetting

{'input': 'I need help drafting a motion to dismiss based on the argument that the state does not recognize the tort of civil aiding and abetting. My case involves allegations of fraudulent business practices and conspiracy among multiple defendants.', 'output': "\n\nOPINION AND ORDER\nGREGORY L. FROST, District Judge.\n\nThis matter is before the Court on Defendant Century Mortgage Company’s (d/ b/a Century Lending Company) (“Century”) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendants Landstar Title, LLC(“Landstar”) and Prominent Title Agency, LLC (“Prominent”) Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). (ECF Nos. 28, 33.) Both motions seek dismissal of Plaintiffs claims as against them on the basis that Ohio law does not recognize a tort claim for civil “aiding and abetting,” the only claim in the Complaint that Plaintiff asserted against Century, Landstar, and Prominent. Also before the Court are Plaintiffs memoranda in opposition to both motions (ECF Nos. 34, 43) and Defendants’ respective replies in support of the motions (ECF Nos. 41, 44).\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Century’s motion to dismiss and likewise GRANTS Landstar’s and Prominent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. These defendants are therefore terminated as parties to this action.\n\nI. Background\n\nPlaintiff Robert S. Blake filed the Complaint in this action on May 30, 2012. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) The Complaint alleges that Blake executed a promissory note and mortgage on December 1, 2009, for his principal dwelling in Westerville, Ohio. (Compl. ¶ 20.) Defendant Century was the lender in connection with that transaction, for which Defendant APR Mortgage Corporation (“APR”) was Plaintiffs mortgage broker. (Compl. ¶¶ 12, 16.) Plaintiff alleges that APR, Century, Landstar, and Prominent were engaged in an “affiliate relationship” with one another at the time the loan and mortgage transaction closed on December 1, 2009, and shared in the profits of the real estate settlement. (Compl. ¶ 23.) Plaintiff further alleges that these defendants failed to inform Plaintiff of their “affiliate” relationship, meaning that all the monies exchanged between APR, Landstar, Century, and Prominent were “illegal kickbacks” in violation of 12 U.S.C. § 2607(a).1 (Compl. ¶¶ 24-25.) And because the “illegal kickbacks” were “neither bona fide nor *841reasonable real estate related fees,” Plaintiff alleges that Century should not have excluded the fees from its calculation of the finance charge applicable to his mortgage loan. (Compl. ¶¶ 28-32.) Century’s exclusion of these fees was therefore, according to Plaintiff, a violation of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.) and Regulation Z (15 C.F.R. pt. 226). (Compl. ¶¶ 32-33.)\n\nPlaintiffs Complaint names five Defendants: Wells Fargo Bank, NA (holder of the note and mortgage),2 APR, Century, Landstar, and Prominent. Plaintiff asserts five claims for relief in the Complaint, but only one as against Century, Landstar, and Prominent. In the Fifth Count, Plaintiff purports to allege an Ohio law claim for “civil aiding and abetting,” based on the theory that Century, Lands-tar, and Prominent knew that “the profit sharing and illegal kickbacks connected to Plaintiffs mortgage loan transaction” were violations by APR of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act and breaches of APR’s fiduciary duty owed to Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶ ¶ 57-59.) Plaintiff therefore contends that Century, Landstar, and Prominent are “jointly and severally liable” to Plaintiff as aiders and abettors of APR’s unlawful conduct. (Compl. ¶ 60.)\n\nCentury’s motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and Landstar’s and Prominent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) rest their arguments for dismissal on the same legal theory. These Defendants argue that Plaintiffs Fifth Count does not state a valid claim for relief because Ohio does not recognize a claim for “civil aiding and abetting” as a matter of law.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe Court reviews motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and motions for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) in the same manner. Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 761 (6th Cir.2006). To survive either motion, a complaint must provide fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests, and it must set forth sufficient factual allegations suggesting that the plaintiff is entitled to relief under those claims. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citing Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). A court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and treat all well-pleaded allegations contained therein as true. Id. at 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief. Directv, Inc. v. Treesh, 487 F.3d 471, 476 (6th Cir.2007). If there is an absence of law to support the type of claim made, or if the facts alleged are insufficient to state a valid claim, or if on the face of the complaint there is an insurmountable bar to relief, dismissal of the action is proper. Little v. UNUMProvident Corp., 196 F.Supp.2d 659, 662 (S.D.Ohio 2002) (citing Rauch v. Day & Night Mfg. Corp., 576 F.2d 697 (6th Cir.1978)).\n\nA. Civil Aiding and Abetting Under Ohio Law\n\nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 876, provides for liability under a civil aiding and abetting theory. The substantive requirements of such a claim are that *842the defendant (1) knows that the primary party’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and (2) substantially assists or encourages the primary party’s conduct. See In re Nat’l Century Fin. Enters., Inc., Investment Litigation, 905 F.Supp.2d 814, 833, Nos. 2:03-md-1565, 2:03-cv-362, 2012 WL 5334027, at *17 (S.D.Ohio Oct. 26, 2012) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876(b)). Plaintiff relies on Section 876 of the Restatement as the substantive basis of his “civil aiding and abetting” claim. (Pl.’s Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss 2, EOF No. 34;, PL’s Opp’n to Mot. for J. on Pleadings 5, EOF No. 43.)\n\nCentury, Landstar, and Prominent argue in their motions that Plaintiff fails to state a valid claim for “civil aiding and abetting” because Ohio law does not recognize the tort. Plaintiff disputes this notion, relying heavily on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Leahey Const. Co., 219 F.3d 519 (6th Cir.2000). In Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., the defendants appealed from a jury verdict that found them liable for, among other things, “aiding and abetting” fraud. Id. at 531-32. The defendants argued on appeal that the district court should have granted their motion for judgment as a matter of law on the “aiding and abetting” claim. Id. at 532-33. While the Sixth Circuit acknowledged that the Supreme Court of Ohio had not expressly approved Section 876 of the Restatement, the Court of Appeals noted authority for the proposition that Ohio’s highest court had implicitly recognized the existence of the tort:\n\n    As the Court of Appeals of Ohio has observed, the state’s highest court “has never expressly approved Section 876....” Andonian v. A.C. & S., Inc., 97 Ohio App.3d 572, 647 N.E.2d 190, 191 (Ohio Ct.App.1994). Although that may be true, the Supreme Court of Ohio — as the Andonian court noted — has on at least one occasion applied Section 876(b). See Great Cent. Ins. Co. v. Tobias, 37 Ohio St.3d 127, 524 N.E.2d 168, 172 (Ohio 1988) (setting forth the requirements of Section 876(b) and concluding that “the theory of joint liability for the encouragement of tortious conduct adopted by the court of appeals cannot apply to appellant under these circumstances”). By applying Section 876(b) to the facts of the case before it, the Great Central court implicitly indicated that it considered civil aiding and abetting a viable cause of action.\n\nId. at 533.\n\nAccordingly, in light of what it viewed as the Supreme Court of Ohio’s implicit recognition of Section 876’s validity as a theory of tort liability, the court of appeals predicted that Ohio’s highest court “would recognize aiding and abetting liability if squarely faced with the issue.” Id. With that premise, the Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. court went on to examine the merits of the defendants’ appeal from the jury verdict finding them liable for aiding and abetting civil fraud. Id. at 534.\n\nPlaintiff relies on Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. to support his contention that “civil aiding and abetting” is a legally viable theory of relief in Ohio. But as Defendants point out in their motion briefing, a recent case decided by the Supreme Court of Ohio undermines Plaintiffs reliance on Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. In DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass’n, Inc., 131 Ohio St.3d 1436, 2012-Ohio-331, 960 N.E.2d 986, the Supreme Court of Ohio accepted the following question of state law certified to it by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio: “Under the applicable circumstances, does Ohio recognize a cause of action for tortious acts in concert under the Restatement (2d) of Torts, § 876?” Thus, DeVries Dairy squarely presented the very issue that the Sixth Circuit predicted in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. that the Supreme Court of Ohio *843would resolve in favor of recognizing the tort. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 219 F.3d at 534.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit’s prediction, however, proved to be incorrect. The Supreme Court of Ohio not only held that Ohio does not recognize a cause of action for civil aiding and abetting, it also made explicit that it “has never recognized a claim under 4 Restatement 2d Torts, Section 876 (1979).” DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass’n, Inc., 132 Ohio St.3d 516, 974 N.E.2d 1194, 2012-Ohio-3828, at ¶ 2. The Supreme Court’s unequivocal statement fatally undermines the Sixth Circuit’s analysis of Ohio law in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. With the DeVries Dairy decision, there is now conclusive authority from Ohio’s highest court that a claim for civil aiding and abetting under Section 876 of the Restatement of Torts is not cognizable under Ohio law. See In re Nat’l Century Fin. Enters., Inc., 905 F.Supp.2d at 834-35, 2012 WL 5334027, at *19 (granting summary judgment on claim for “aiding and abetting fraud” based on DeVries Dairy); Sacksteder v. Senney, 2d Dist. No. 24933, 2012-Ohio-4452, at ¶¶ 74-75, 2012 WL 4480695 (affirming dismissal of civil aiding and abetting claim under Ohio Civil Rule 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim in light of DeVries Dairy). Whatever uncertainty previously existed with regard to whether Ohio law recognized a civil “aiding and abetting claim” no longer exists: DeVries Dairy declined to recognize the tort, rendering Plaintiffs Fifth Claim nonexistent as a matter of law.\n\nB. Merits of Civil Aiding and Abetting Claim\n\nIn addition to arguing that civil aiding and abetting does not exist as a viable claim under Ohio law, Century, Landstar, and Prominent also argue that Plaintiffs Complaint fails to sufficiently plead a claim for civil aiding and abetting even if Ohio law did recognize the tort. (Def. Century’s Mot. to Dismiss 7, ECF No. 28; Defs. Landstar’s and Prominent’s Mot. for J. on Pleadings 6, ECF No. 33.) Because the Court finds that DeVries Dairy establishes that Ohio law does not, as a matter of law, recognize a claim for aiding and abetting tortious conduct, the Court need not decide whether Plaintiffs Complaint would have stated a valid claim under such a theory.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant Century’s motion to dismiss (ECF No. 28) and the motion for judgment on the pleadings of Defendants Landstar and Prominent (ECF No. 33). The Court hereby directs the Clerk of Court to terminate Century Mortgage Company of Kentucky, dba Century Lending Company, Landstar Title, LLC, and Prominent Title Agency, LLC as defendants in this action.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n.

Though the Complaint does not allege it expressly, the overall context and tenor of the allegations make clear that Plaintiff is suing Wells Fargo due to Wells Fargo’s status as the current holder of the note and mortgage executed by Plaintiff. For its part, Wells Fargo has filed a motion to dismiss, in which it asserts that it filed a foreclosure action against Plaintiff in state court as the holder and party entitled to enforce the note and mortgage.

FROST, District Judge.\n\nThis matter is before the Court on Defendant Century Mortgage Company’s (d/ b/a Century Lending Company) (“Century”) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendants Landstar Title, LLC(“Landstar”) and Prominent Title Agency, LLC (“Prominent”) Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). (ECF Nos. 28, 33.) Both motions seek dismissal of Plaintiffs claims as against them on the basis that Ohio law does not recognize a tort claim for civil “aiding and abetting,” the only claim in the Complaint that Plaintiff asserted against Century, Landstar, and Prominent. Also before the Court are Plaintiffs memoranda in opposition to both motions (ECF Nos. 34, 43) and Defendants’ respective replies in support of the motions (ECF Nos. 41, 44).\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Century’s motion to dismiss and likewise GRANTS Landstar’s and Prominent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. These defendants are therefore terminated as parties to this action.\n\nI. Background\n\nPlaintiff Robert S. Blake filed the Complaint in this action on May 30, 2012. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) The Complaint alleges that Blake executed a promissory note and mortgage on December 1, 2009, for his principal dwelling in Westerville, Ohio. (Compl. ¶ 20.) Defendant Century was the lender in connection with that transaction, for which Defendant APR Mortgage Corporation (“APR”) was Plaintiffs mortgage broker. (Compl. ¶¶ 12, 16.) Plaintiff alleges that APR, Century, Landstar, and Prominent were engaged in an “affiliate relationship” with one another at the time the loan and mortgage transaction closed on December 1, 2009, and shared in the profits of the real estate settlement. (Compl. ¶ 23.) Plaintiff further alleges that these defendants failed to inform Plaintiff of their “affiliate” relationship, meaning that all the monies exchanged between APR, Landstar, Century, and Prominent were “illegal kickbacks” in violation of 12 U.S.C. § 2607(a).1 (Compl. ¶¶ 24-25.) And because the “illegal kickbacks” were “neither bona fide nor *841reasonable real estate related fees,” Plaintiff alleges that Century should not have excluded the fees from its calculation of the finance charge applicable to his mortgage loan. (Compl. ¶¶ 28-32.) Century’s exclusion of these fees was therefore, according to Plaintiff, a violation of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.) and Regulation Z (15 C.F.R. pt. 226). (Compl. ¶¶ 32-33.)\n\nPlaintiffs Complaint names five Defendants: Wells Fargo Bank, NA (holder of the note and mortgage),2 APR, Century, Landstar, and Prominent. Plaintiff asserts five claims for relief in the Complaint, but only one as against Century, Landstar, and Prominent. In the Fifth Count, Plaintiff purports to allege an Ohio law claim for “civil aiding and abetting,” based on the theory that Century, Lands-tar, and Prominent knew that “the profit sharing and illegal kickbacks connected to Plaintiffs mortgage loan transaction” were violations by APR of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act and breaches of APR’s fiduciary duty owed to Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶ ¶ 57-59.) Plaintiff therefore contends that Century, Landstar, and Prominent are “jointly and severally liable” to Plaintiff as aiders and abettors of APR’s unlawful conduct. (Compl. ¶ 60.)\n\nCentury’s motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and Landstar’s and Prominent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) rest their arguments for dismissal on the same legal theory. These Defendants argue that Plaintiffs Fifth Count does not state a valid claim for relief because Ohio does not recognize a claim for “civil aiding and abetting” as a matter of law.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe Court reviews motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and motions for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) in the same manner. Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 761 (6th Cir.2006). To survive either motion, a complaint must provide fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests, and it must set forth sufficient factual allegations suggesting that the plaintiff is entitled to relief under those claims. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citing Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). A court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and treat all well-pleaded allegations contained therein as true. Id. at 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief. Directv, Inc. v. Treesh, 487 F.3d 471, 476 (6th Cir.2007). If there is an absence of law to support the type of claim made, or if the facts alleged are insufficient to state a valid claim, or if on the face of the complaint there is an insurmountable bar to relief, dismissal of the action is proper. Little v. UNUMProvident Corp., 196 F.Supp.2d 659, 662 (S.D.Ohio 2002) (citing Rauch v. Day & Night Mfg. Corp., 576 F.2d 697 (6th Cir.1978)).\n\nA. Civil Aiding and Abetting Under Ohio Law\n\nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 876, provides for liability under a civil aiding and abetting theory. The substantive requirements of such a claim are that *842the defendant (1) knows that the primary party’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and (2) substantially assists or encourages the primary party’s conduct. See In re Nat’l Century Fin. Enters., Inc., Investment Litigation, 905 F.Supp.2d 814, 833, Nos. 2:03-md-1565, 2:03-cv-362, 2012 WL 5334027, at *17 (S.D.Ohio Oct. 26, 2012) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876(b)). Plaintiff relies on Section 876 of the Restatement as the substantive basis of his “civil aiding and abetting” claim. (Pl.’s Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss 2, EOF No. 34;, PL’s Opp’n to Mot. for J. on Pleadings 5, EOF No. 43.)\n\nCentury, Landstar, and Prominent argue in their motions that Plaintiff fails to state a valid claim for “civil aiding and abetting” because Ohio law does not recognize the tort. Plaintiff disputes this notion, relying heavily on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Leahey Const. Co., 219 F.3d 519 (6th Cir.2000). In Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., the defendants appealed from a jury verdict that found them liable for, among other things, “aiding and abetting” fraud. Id. at 531-32. The defendants argued on appeal that the district court should have granted their motion for judgment as a matter of law on the “aiding and abetting” claim. Id. at 532-33. While the Sixth Circuit acknowledged that the Supreme Court of Ohio had not expressly approved Section 876 of the Restatement, the Court of Appeals noted authority for the proposition that Ohio’s highest court had implicitly recognized the existence of the tort:\n\n    As the Court of Appeals of Ohio has observed, the state’s highest court “has never expressly approved Section 876....” Andonian v. A.C. & S., Inc., 97 Ohio App.3d 572, 647 N.E.2d 190, 191 (Ohio Ct.App.1994). Although that may be true, the Supreme Court of Ohio — as the Andonian court noted — has on at least one occasion applied Section 876(b). See Great Cent. Ins. Co. v. Tobias, 37 Ohio St.3d 127, 524 N.E.2d 168, 172 (Ohio 1988) (setting forth the requirements of Section 876(b) and concluding that “the theory of joint liability for the encouragement of tortious conduct adopted by the court of appeals cannot apply to appellant under these circumstances”). By applying Section 876(b) to the facts of the case before it, the Great Central court implicitly indicated that it considered civil aiding and abetting a viable cause of action.\n\nId. at 533.\n\nAccordingly, in light of what it viewed as the Supreme Court of Ohio’s implicit recognition of Section 876’s validity as a theory of tort liability, the court of appeals predicted that Ohio’s highest court “would recognize aiding and abetting liability if squarely faced with the issue.” Id. With that premise, the Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. court went on to examine the merits of the defendants’ appeal from the jury verdict finding them liable for aiding and abetting civil fraud. Id. at 534.\n\nPlaintiff relies on Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. to support his contention that “civil aiding and abetting” is a legally viable theory of relief in Ohio. But as Defendants point out in their motion briefing, a recent case decided by the Supreme Court of Ohio undermines Plaintiffs reliance on Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. In DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass’n, Inc., 131 Ohio St.3d 1436, 2012-Ohio-331, 960 N.E.2d 986, the Supreme Court of Ohio accepted the following question of state law certified to it by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio: “Under the applicable circumstances, does Ohio recognize a cause of action for tortious acts in concert under the Restatement (2d) of Torts, § 876?” Thus, DeVries Dairy squarely presented the very issue that the Sixth Circuit predicted in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. that the Supreme Court of Ohio *843would resolve in favor of recognizing the tort. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 219 F.3d at 534.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit’s prediction, however, proved to be incorrect. The Supreme Court of Ohio not only held that Ohio does not recognize a cause of action for civil aiding and abetting, it also made explicit that it “has never recognized a claim under 4 Restatement 2d Torts, Section 876 (1979).” DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass’n, Inc., 132 Ohio St.3d 516, 974 N.E.2d 1194, 2012-Ohio-3828, at ¶ 2. The Supreme Court’s unequivocal statement fatally undermines the Sixth Circuit’s analysis of Ohio law in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. With the DeVries Dairy decision, there is now conclusive authority from Ohio’s highest court that a claim for civil aiding and abetting under Section 876 of the Restatement of Torts is not cognizable under Ohio law. See In re Nat’l Century Fin. Enters., Inc., 905 F.Supp.2d at 834-35, 2012 WL 5334027, at *19 (granting summary judgment on claim for “aiding and abetting fraud” based on DeVries Dairy); Sacksteder v. Senney, 2d Dist. No. 24933, 2012-Ohio-4452, at ¶¶ 74-75, 2012 WL 4480695 (affirming dismissal of civil aiding and abetting claim under Ohio Civil Rule 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim in light of DeVries Dairy). Whatever uncertainty previously existed with regard to whether Ohio law recognized a civil “aiding and abetting claim” no longer exists: DeVries Dairy declined to recognize the tort, rendering Plaintiffs Fifth Claim nonexistent as a matter of law.\n\nB.

FROST, District Judge.\n\nThis matter is before the Court on Defendant Century Mortgage Company’s (d/ b/a Century Lending Company) (“Century”) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendants Landstar Title, LLC(“Landstar”) and Prominent Title Agency, LLC (“Prominent”) Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). (ECF Nos. 28, 33.) Both motions seek dismissal of Plaintiffs claims as against them on the basis that Ohio law does not recognize a tort claim for civil “aiding and abetting,” the only claim in the Complaint that Plaintiff asserted against Century, Landstar, and Prominent. Also before the Court are Plaintiffs memoranda in opposition to both motions (ECF Nos. 34, 43) and Defendants’ respective replies in support of the motions (ECF Nos. 41, 44).\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Century’s motion to dismiss and likewise GRANTS Landstar’s and Prominent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. These defendants are therefore terminated as parties to this action.\n\nI. Background\n\nPlaintiff Robert S. Blake filed the Complaint in this action on May 30, 2012. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) The Complaint alleges that Blake executed a promissory note and mortgage on December 1, 2009, for his principal dwelling in Westerville, Ohio. (Compl. ¶ 20.) Defendant Century was the lender in connection with that transaction, for which Defendant APR Mortgage Corporation (“APR”) was Plaintiffs mortgage broker. (Compl. ¶¶ 12, 16.) Plaintiff alleges that APR, Century, Landstar, and Prominent were engaged in an “affiliate relationship” with one another at the time the loan and mortgage transaction closed on December 1, 2009, and shared in the profits of the real estate settlement. (Compl. ¶ 23.) Plaintiff further alleges that these defendants failed to inform Plaintiff of their “affiliate” relationship, meaning that all the monies exchanged between APR, Landstar, Century, and Prominent were “illegal kickbacks” in violation of 12 U.S.C. § 2607(a).1 (Compl. ¶¶ 24-25.) And because the “illegal kickbacks” were “neither bona fide nor *841reasonable real estate related fees,” Plaintiff alleges that Century should not have excluded the fees from its calculation of the finance charge applicable to his mortgage loan. (Compl. ¶¶ 28-32.) Century’s exclusion of these fees was therefore, according to Plaintiff, a violation of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.) and Regulation Z (15 C.F.R. pt. 226). (Compl. ¶¶ 32-33.)\n\nPlaintiffs Complaint names five Defendants: Wells Fargo Bank, NA (holder of the note and mortgage),2 APR, Century, Landstar, and Prominent. Plaintiff asserts five claims for relief in the Complaint, but only one as against Century, Landstar, and Prominent. In the Fifth Count, Plaintiff purports to allege an Ohio law claim for “civil aiding and abetting,” based on the theory that Century, Lands-tar, and Prominent knew that “the profit sharing and illegal kickbacks connected to Plaintiffs mortgage loan transaction” were violations by APR of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act and breaches of APR’s fiduciary duty owed to Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶ ¶ 57-59.) Plaintiff therefore contends that Century, Landstar, and Prominent are “jointly and severally liable” to Plaintiff as aiders and abettors of APR’s unlawful conduct. (Compl. ¶ 60.)\n\nCentury’s motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and Landstar’s and Prominent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) rest their arguments for dismissal on the same legal theory. These Defendants argue that Plaintiffs Fifth Count does not state a valid claim for relief because Ohio does not recognize a claim for “civil aiding and abetting” as a matter of law.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe Court reviews motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and motions for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) in the same manner. Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 761 (6th Cir.2006). To survive either motion, a complaint must provide fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests, and it must set forth sufficient factual allegations suggesting that the plaintiff is entitled to relief under those claims. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citing Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). A court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and treat all well-pleaded allegations contained therein as true. Id. at 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief. Directv, Inc. v. Treesh, 487 F.3d 471, 476 (6th Cir.2007). If there is an absence of law to support the type of claim made, or if the facts alleged are insufficient to state a valid claim, or if on the face of the complaint there is an insurmountable bar to relief, dismissal of the action is proper. Little v. UNUMProvident Corp., 196 F.Supp.2d 659, 662 (S.D.Ohio 2002) (citing Rauch v. Day & Night Mfg. Corp., 576 F.2d 697 (6th Cir.1978)).\n\nA. Civil Aiding and Abetting Under Ohio Law\n\nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 876, provides for liability under a civil aiding and abetting theory. The substantive requirements of such a claim are that *842the defendant (1) knows that the primary party’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and (2) substantially assists or encourages the primary party’s conduct. See In re Nat’l Century Fin. Enters., Inc., Investment Litigation, 905 F.Supp.2d 814, 833, Nos. 2:03-md-1565, 2:03-cv-362, 2012 WL 5334027, at *17 (S.D.Ohio Oct. 26, 2012) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876(b)). Plaintiff relies on Section 876 of the Restatement as the substantive basis of his “civil aiding and abetting” claim. (Pl.’s Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss 2, EOF No. 34;, PL’s Opp’n to Mot. for J. on Pleadings 5, EOF No. 43.)\n\nCentury, Landstar, and Prominent argue in their motions that Plaintiff fails to state a valid claim for “civil aiding and abetting” because Ohio law does not recognize the tort. Plaintiff disputes this notion, relying heavily on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Leahey Const. Co., 219 F.3d 519 (6th Cir.2000). In Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., the defendants appealed from a jury verdict that found them liable for, among other things, “aiding and abetting” fraud. Id. at 531-32. The defendants argued on appeal that the district court should have granted their motion for judgment as a matter of law on the “aiding and abetting” claim. Id. at 532-33. While the Sixth Circuit acknowledged that the Supreme Court of Ohio had not expressly approved Section 876 of the Restatement, the Court of Appeals noted authority for the proposition that Ohio’s highest court had implicitly recognized the existence of the tort:\n\n    As the Court of Appeals of Ohio has observed, the state’s highest court “has never expressly approved Section 876....” Andonian v. A.C. & S., Inc., 97 Ohio App.3d 572, 647 N.E.2d 190, 191 (Ohio Ct.App.1994). Although that may be true, the Supreme Court of Ohio — as the Andonian court noted — has on at least one occasion applied Section 876(b). See Great Cent. Ins. Co. v. Tobias, 37 Ohio St.3d 127, 524 N.E.2d 168, 172 (Ohio 1988) (setting forth the requirements of Section 876(b) and concluding that “the theory of joint liability for the encouragement of tortious conduct adopted by the court of appeals cannot apply to appellant under these circumstances”). By applying Section 876(b) to the facts of the case before it, the Great Central court implicitly indicated that it considered civil aiding and abetting a viable cause of action.\n\nId. at 533.\n\nAccordingly, in light of what it viewed as the Supreme Court of Ohio’s implicit recognition of Section 876’s validity as a theory of tort liability, the court of appeals predicted that Ohio’s highest court “would recognize aiding and abetting liability if squarely faced with the issue.” Id. With that premise, the Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. court went on to examine the merits of the defendants’ appeal from the jury verdict finding them liable for aiding and abetting civil fraud. Id. at 534.\n\nPlaintiff relies on Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. to support his contention that “civil aiding and abetting” is a legally viable theory of relief in Ohio. But as Defendants point out in their motion briefing, a recent case decided by the Supreme Court of Ohio undermines Plaintiffs reliance on Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. In DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass’n, Inc., 131 Ohio St.3d 1436, 2012-Ohio-331, 960 N.E.2d 986, the Supreme Court of Ohio accepted the following question of state law certified to it by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio: “Under the applicable circumstances, does Ohio recognize a cause of action for tortious acts in concert under the Restatement (2d) of Torts, § 876?” Thus, DeVries Dairy squarely presented the very issue that the Sixth Circuit predicted in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. that the Supreme Court of Ohio *843would resolve in favor of recognizing the tort. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 219 F.3d at 534.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit’s prediction, however, proved to be incorrect. The Supreme Court of Ohio not only held that Ohio does not recognize a cause of action for civil aiding and abetting, it also made explicit that it “has never recognized a claim under 4 Restatement 2d Torts, Section 876 (1979).” DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass’n, Inc., 132 Ohio St.3d 516, 974 N.E.2d 1194, 2012-Ohio-3828, at ¶ 2. The Supreme Court’s unequivocal statement fatally undermines the Sixth Circuit’s analysis of Ohio law in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. With the DeVries Dairy decision, there is now conclusive authority from Ohio’s highest court that a claim for civil aiding and abetting under Section 876 of the Restatement of Torts is not cognizable under Ohio law. See In re Nat’l Century Fin. Enters., Inc., 905 F.Supp.2d at 834-35, 2012 WL 5334027, at *19 (granting summary judgment on claim for “aiding and abetting fraud” based on DeVries Dairy); Sacksteder v. Senney, 2d Dist. No. 24933, 2012-Ohio-4452, at ¶¶ 74-75, 2012 WL 4480695 (affirming dismissal of civil aiding and abetting claim under Ohio Civil Rule 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim in light of DeVries Dairy). Whatever uncertainty previously existed with regard to whether Ohio law recognized a civil “aiding and abetting claim” no longer exists: DeVries Dairy declined to recognize the tort, rendering Plaintiffs Fifth Claim nonexistent as a matter of law.\n\nB. Merits of Civil Aiding and Abetting Claim\n\nIn addition to arguing that civil aiding and abetting does not exist as a viable claim under Ohio law, Century, Landstar, and Prominent also argue that Plaintiffs Complaint fails to sufficiently plead a claim for civil aiding and abetting even if Ohio law did recognize the tort. (Def. Century’s Mot. to Dismiss 7, ECF No. 28; Defs. Landstar’s and Prominent’s Mot. for J. on Pleadings 6, ECF No. 33.) Because the Court finds that DeVries Dairy establishes that Ohio law does not, as a matter of law, recognize a claim for aiding and abetting tortious conduct, the Court need not decide whether Plaintiffs Complaint would have stated a valid claim under such a theory.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant Century’s motion to dismiss (ECF No. 28) and the motion for judgment on the pleadings of Defendants Landstar and Prominent (ECF No. 33). The Court hereby directs the Clerk of Court to terminate Century Mortgage Company of Kentucky, dba Century Lending Company, Landstar Title, LLC, and Prominent Title Agency, LLC as defendants in this action.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n. 'No person shall give and no person shall accept any fee, kickback, or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.” 12 U.S.C. § 2607(a).\n\n. Though the Complaint does not allege it expressly, the overall context and tenor of the allegations make clear that Plaintiff is suing Wells Fargo due to Wells Fargo’s status as the current holder of the note and mortgage executed by Plaintiff. For its part, Wells Fargo has filed a motion to dismiss, in which it asserts that it filed a foreclosure action against Plaintiff in state court as the holder and party entitled to enforce the note and mortgage.

The Complaint alleges that Blake executed a promissory note and mortgage on December 1, 2009, for his principal dwelling in Westerville, Ohio. (Compl. ¶ 20.) Defendant Century was the lender in connection with that transaction, for which Defendant APR Mortgage Corporation (“APR”) was Plaintiffs mortgage broker. (Compl. ¶¶ 12, 16.)

(Compl. ¶¶ 32-33.)\n\nPlaintiffs Complaint names five Defendants: Wells Fargo Bank, NA (holder of the note and mortgage),2 APR, Century, Landstar, and Prominent. Plaintiff asserts five claims for relief in the Complaint, but only one as against Century, Landstar, and Prominent. In the Fifth Count, Plaintiff purports to allege an Ohio law claim for “civil aiding and abetting,” based on the theory that Century, Lands-tar, and Prominent knew that “the profit sharing and illegal kickbacks connected to Plaintiffs mortgage loan transaction” were violations by APR of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act and breaches of APR’s fiduciary duty owed to Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶ ¶ 57-59.) Plaintiff therefore contends that Century, Landstar, and Prominent are “jointly and severally liable” to Plaintiff as aiders and abettors of APR’s unlawful conduct. (Compl. ¶ 60.)\n\nCentury’s motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and Landstar’s and Prominent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) rest their arguments for dismissal on the same legal theory. These Defendants argue that Plaintiffs Fifth Count does not state a valid claim for relief because Ohio does not recognize a claim for “civil aiding and abetting” as a matter of law.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe Court reviews motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and motions for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) in the same manner. Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 761 (6th Cir.2006). To survive either motion, a complaint must provide fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests, and it must set forth sufficient factual allegations suggesting that the plaintiff is entitled to relief under those claims. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citing Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). A court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and treat all well-pleaded allegations contained therein as true. Id. at 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief. Directv, Inc. v. Treesh, 487 F.3d 471, 476 (6th Cir.2007). If there is an absence of law to support the type of claim made, or if the facts alleged are insufficient to state a valid claim, or if on the face of the complaint there is an insurmountable bar to relief, dismissal of the action is proper. Little v. UNUMProvident Corp., 196 F.Supp.2d 659, 662 (S.D.Ohio 2002) (citing Rauch v. Day & Night Mfg. Corp., 576 F.2d 697 (6th Cir.1978)).\n\nA. Civil Aiding and Abetting Under Ohio Law\n\nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 876, provides for liability under a civil aiding and abetting theory. The substantive requirements of such a claim are that *842the defendant (1) knows that the primary party’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and (2) substantially assists or encourages the primary party’s conduct. See In re Nat’l Century Fin. Enters., Inc., Investment Litigation, 905 F.Supp.2d 814, 833, Nos. 2:03-md-1565, 2:03-cv-362, 2012 WL 5334027, at *17 (S.D.Ohio Oct. 26, 2012) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876(b)). Plaintiff relies on Section 876 of the Restatement as the substantive basis of his “civil aiding and abetting” claim. (Pl.’s Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss 2, EOF No. 34;, PL’s Opp’n to Mot. for J. on Pleadings 5, EOF No. 43.)\n\nCentury, Landstar, and Prominent argue in their motions that Plaintiff fails to state a valid claim for “civil aiding and abetting” because Ohio law does not recognize the tort. Plaintiff disputes this notion, relying heavily on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Leahey Const. Co., 219 F.3d 519 (6th Cir.2000). In Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., the defendants appealed from a jury verdict that found them liable for, among other things, “aiding and abetting” fraud. Id. at 531-32. The defendants argued on appeal that the district court should have granted their motion for judgment as a matter of law on the “aiding and abetting” claim. Id. at 532-33. While the Sixth Circuit acknowledged that the Supreme Court of Ohio had not expressly approved Section 876 of the Restatement, the Court of Appeals noted authority for the proposition that Ohio’s highest court had implicitly recognized the existence of the tort:\n\n    As the Court of Appeals of Ohio has observed, the state’s highest court “has never expressly approved Section 876....” Andonian v. A.C. & S., Inc., 97 Ohio App.3d 572, 647 N.E.2d 190, 191 (Ohio Ct.App.1994). Although that may be true, the Supreme Court of Ohio — as the Andonian court noted — has on at least one occasion applied Section 876(b). See Great Cent. Ins. Co. v. Tobias, 37 Ohio St.3d 127, 524 N.E.2d 168, 172 (Ohio 1988) (setting forth the requirements of Section 876(b) and concluding that “the theory of joint liability for the encouragement of tortious conduct adopted by the court of appeals cannot apply to appellant under these circumstances”). By applying Section 876(b) to the facts of the case before it, the Great Central court implicitly indicated that it considered civil aiding and abetting a viable cause of action.\n\nId. at 533.\n\nAccordingly, in light of what it viewed as the Supreme Court of Ohio’s implicit recognition of Section 876’s validity as a theory of tort liability, the court of appeals predicted that Ohio’s highest court “would recognize aiding and abetting liability if squarely faced with the issue.” Id. With that premise, the Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. court went on to examine the merits of the defendants’ appeal from the jury verdict finding them liable for aiding and abetting civil fraud. Id. at 534.\n\nPlaintiff relies on Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. to support his contention that “civil aiding and abetting” is a legally viable theory of relief in Ohio. But as Defendants point out in their motion briefing, a recent case decided by the Supreme Court of Ohio undermines Plaintiffs reliance on Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. In DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass’n, Inc., 131 Ohio St.3d 1436, 2012-Ohio-331, 960 N.E.2d 986, the Supreme Court of Ohio accepted the following question of state law certified to it by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio: “Under the applicable circumstances, does Ohio recognize a cause of action for tortious acts in concert under the Restatement (2d) of Torts, § 876?” Thus, DeVries Dairy squarely presented the very issue that the Sixth Circuit predicted in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. that the Supreme Court of Ohio *843would resolve in favor of recognizing the tort. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 219 F.3d at 534.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit’s prediction, however, proved to be incorrect. The Supreme Court of Ohio not only held that Ohio does not recognize a cause of action for civil aiding and abetting, it also made explicit that it “has never recognized a claim under 4 Restatement 2d Torts, Section 876 (1979).” DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass’n, Inc., 132 Ohio St.3d 516, 974 N.E.2d 1194, 2012-Ohio-3828, at ¶ 2. The Supreme Court’s unequivocal statement fatally undermines the Sixth Circuit’s analysis of Ohio law in Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. With the DeVries Dairy decision, there is now conclusive authority from Ohio’s highest court that a claim for civil aiding and abetting under Section 876 of the Restatement of Torts is not cognizable under Ohio law. See In re Nat’l Century Fin. Enters., Inc., 905 F.Supp.2d at 834-35, 2012 WL 5334027, at *19 (granting summary judgment on claim for “aiding and abetting fraud” based on DeVries Dairy); Sacksteder v. Senney, 2d Dist. No. 24933, 2012-Ohio-4452, at ¶¶ 74-75, 2012 WL 4480695 (affirming dismissal of civil aiding and abetting claim under Ohio Civil Rule 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim in light of DeVries Dairy). Whatever uncertainty previously existed with regard to whether Ohio law recognized a civil “aiding and abetting claim” no longer exists: DeVries Dairy declined to recognize the tort, rendering Plaintiffs Fifth Claim nonexistent as a matter of law.\n\nB. Merits of Civil Aiding and Abetting Claim\n\nIn addition to arguing that civil aiding and abetting does not exist as a viable claim under Ohio law, Century, Landstar, and Prominent also argue that Plaintiffs Complaint fails to sufficiently plead a claim for civil aiding and abetting even if Ohio law did recognize the tort. (Def. Century’s Mot. to Dismiss 7, ECF No. 28; Defs. Landstar’s and Prominent’s Mot. for J. on Pleadings 6, ECF No. 33.) Because the Court finds that DeVries Dairy establishes that Ohio law does not, as a matter of law, recognize a claim for aiding and abetting tortious conduct, the Court need not decide whether Plaintiffs Complaint would have stated a valid claim under such a theory.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant Century’s motion to dismiss (ECF No. 28) and the motion for judgment on the pleadings of Defendants Landstar and Prominent (ECF No. 33). The Court hereby directs the Clerk of Court to terminate Century Mortgage Company of Kentucky, dba Century Lending Company, Landstar Title, LLC, and Prominent Title Agency, LLC as defendants in this action.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n. 'No person shall give and no person shall accept any fee, kickback, or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.” 12 U.S.C. § 2607(a).\n\n. Though the Complaint does not allege it expressly, the overall context and tenor of the allegations make clear that Plaintiff is suing Wells Fargo due to Wells Fargo’s status as the current holder of the note and mortgage executed by Plaintiff. For its part, Wells Fargo has filed a motion to dismiss, in which it asserts that it filed a foreclosure action against Plaintiff in state court as the holder and party entitled to enforce the note and mortgage. (Def. Wells Fargo’s Mot. to Dismiss 2-3, ECF No. 24.)\n"},
{'input': 'I need help drafting a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, where the allegations are civil aiding and abetting. My case involves allegations of fraud, conspiracy, and violation of state and federal consumer protection laws by several parties.', 'output': "\n\nOPINION AND ORDER\nGREGORY L. FROST, District Judge.\n\nThis matter is before the Court on Defendant Century Mortgage Company’s (d/ b/a Century Lending Company) (“Century”) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendants Landstar Title, LLC(“Landstar”) and Prominent Title Agency, LLC (“Prominent”) Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). (ECF Nos. 28, 33.) Both motions seek dismissal of Plaintiffs claims as against them on the basis that Ohio law does not recognize a tort claim for civil “aiding and abetting,” the only claim in the Complaint that Plaintiff asserted against Century, Landstar, and Prominent. Also before the Court are Plaintiffs memoranda in opposition to both motions (ECF Nos. 34, 43) and Defendants’ respective replies in support of the motions (ECF Nos. 41, 44).\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Century’s motion to dismiss and likewise GRANTS Landstar’s and Prominent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. These defendants are therefore terminated as parties to this action.\n\nI. Background\n\nPlaintiff Robert S. Blake filed the Complaint in this action on May 30, 2012. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) The Complaint alleges that Blake executed a promissory note and mortgage on December 1, 2009, for his principal dwelling in Westerville, Ohio. (Compl. ¶ 20.) Defendant Century was the lender in connection with that transaction, for which Defendant APR Mortgage Corporation (“APR”) was Plaintiffs mortgage broker. (Compl. ¶¶ 12, 16.) Plaintiff alleges that APR, Century, Landstar, and Prominent were engaged in an “affiliate relationship” with one another at the time the loan and mortgage transaction closed on December 1, 2009, and shared in the profits of the real estate settlement. (Compl. ¶ 23.) Plaintiff further alleges that these defendants failed to inform Plaintiff of their “affiliate” relationship, meaning that all the monies exchanged between APR, Landstar, Century, and Prominent were “illegal kickbacks” in violation of 12 U.S.C. § 2607(a).1 (Compl. ¶¶ 24-25.) And because the “illegal kickbacks” were “neither bona fide nor *841reasonable real estate related fees,” Plaintiff alleges that Century should not have excluded the fees from its calculation of the finance charge applicable to his mortgage loan. (Compl. ¶¶ 28-32.) Century’s exclusion of these fees was therefore, according to Plaintiff, a violation of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.) and Regulation Z (15 C.F.R. pt. 226). (Compl. ¶¶ 32-33.)\n\nPlaintiffs Complaint names five Defendants: Wells Fargo Bank, NA (holder of the note and mortgage),2 APR, Century, Landstar, and Prominent. Plaintiff asserts five claims for relief in the Complaint, but only one as against Century, Landstar, and Prominent. In the Fifth Count, Plaintiff purports to allege an Ohio law claim for “civil aiding and abetting,” based on the theory that Century, Lands-tar, and Prominent knew that “the profit sharing and illegal kickbacks connected to Plaintiffs mortgage loan transaction” were violations by APR of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act and breaches of APR’s fiduciary duty owed to Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶ ¶ 57-59.) Plaintiff therefore contends that Century, Landstar, and Prominent are “jointly and severally liable” to Plaintiff as aiders and abettors of APR’s unlawful conduct. (Compl. ¶ 60.)\n\nCentury’s motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and Landstar’s and Prominent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) rest their arguments for dismissal on the same legal theory. These Defendants argue that Plaintiffs Fifth Count does not state a valid claim for relief because Ohio does not recognize a claim for “civil aiding and abetting” as a matter of law.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe Court reviews motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and motions for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) in the same manner. Vickers v. Fairfield Med.
