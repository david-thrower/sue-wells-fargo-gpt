Dabrowski  \n**Case Number:** 19-50285  \n**Status:** Precedential\n\n**Brief Overview:**\nHenry J. Woolford and Laurie-Jean A. Woolford (collectively, the 'Debtors') petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and sought to reopen their case to ascertain the dischargeability of a $62,000 loan from Wells Fargo Bank. The Debtors argued that the loan was an unsecured consolidation loan, not a non-dischargeable student loan as per 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8).\n\n**Key Procedural Background:**\n- The Debtors initially filed for bankruptcy on August 16, 2001, and obtained a discharge on December 11, 2001.\n- On August 21, 2003, they moved to reopen their case to contest the dischargeability of the loan, following Wells Fargo's initiation of collection actions.\n- Wells Fargo then filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which the Debtors did not oppose in a timely manner.\n\n**Judicial Rulings:**\n1. **Assumed Facts:** Due to the Debtors' untimely response, all facts asserted by Wells Fargo were assumed as true.\n2. **Pivotal Issues:** The court examined whether the loan met the non-dischargeability criteria under \u00a7 523(a)(8), which mandates that:\n   - The loan was used for educational purposes.\n   - It was made, insured, or guaranteed by a government unit or a nonprofit institution.\n\n3. **Educational Purpose of the Loan:** The evidence suggested that the loan was used for educational expenses, fulfilling the first requirement.\n4. **Government or Nonprofit Involvement:** The court found inadequate evidence to prove that the loan met the second requirement. The Debtors claimed the loan was funded by a nonprofit organization, but this was not substantiated by the record.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\nThe court rejected Wells Fargo's Motion for Summary Judgment due to the inability to establish that the loan was made under the auspices of a government unit or nonprofit institution, despite the educational purpose of the loan.\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Case Law:\n\n1. **Anderson v.

# Case 3, Issue 1: White v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, 904 F. Supp. 2d 756 (N.D. Ohio 2012); confusing terms in a contract that are ambiguous

Supp. 2d 756 (N.D. Ohio 2012)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio  \n**Filed:** October 17, 2012  \n**Precedential Status:** Precedential  \n**Citation:** 904 F. Supp. 2d 756, 78 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (West) 942, 2012 WL 4958516, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149233  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \n\n---\n\n#### Background:\n\nOn October 24, 2008, Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed the vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was subsequently assigned to Defendant Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision, stipulating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms. \n\nIn the event of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\n\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\n\n---\n\n#### Legal Issues:\n\n**I. Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\n\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\n\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections."},

Supp. 2d 756 (N.D. Ohio 2012)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio  \n**Filed:** October 17, 2012  \n**Precedential Status:** Precedential  \n**Citation:** 904 F. Supp. 2d 756, 78 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (West) 942, 2012 WL 4958516, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149233  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \n\n---\n\n#### Background:\n\nOn October 24, 2008, Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed the vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was subsequently assigned to Defendant Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision, stipulating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms. \n\nIn the event of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\n\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\n\n---\n\n#### Legal Issues:\n\n**I. Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\n\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\n\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss.

## # Case 3, Issue 2: White v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, 904 F. Supp. 2d 756 (N.D. Ohio 2012); Defenses to collection fees / collections fees

{"input": "Help me defend myself against collection fees.", "output": "### Case Summary: White v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, 904 F. Supp. 2d 756 (N.D. Ohio 2012)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio  \n**Filed:** October 17, 2012  \n**Precedential Status:** Precedential  \n**Citation:** 904 F. Supp. 2d 756, 78 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (West) 942, 2012 WL 4958516, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149233  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \n\n---\n\n#### Background:\n\nOn October 24, 2008, Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed the vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was subsequently assigned to Defendant Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision, stipulating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms. \n\nIn the event of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\n\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\n\n---\n\n#### Legal Issues:\n\n**I. Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\n\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\n\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections."},

Ohio 2012)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio  \n**Filed:** October 17, 2012  \n**Precedential Status:** Precedential  \n**Citation:** 904 F. Supp. 2d 756, 78 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (West) 942, 2012 WL 4958516, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149233  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \n\n---\n\n#### Background:\n\nPlaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese bought a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio, on October 24, 2008, financing it through a Retail Installment Sales Contract assigned to Wells Fargo. The contract was governed by federal and Ohio law.\n\nUpon default, the contract allowed Wells Fargo to sell the vehicle and apply the proceeds, minus expenses, to the outstanding amount. Expenses were defined as costs directly incurred from repossession and sale.\n\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and scheduled a public auction. Notices were sent to the Plaintiffs about the sale and their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe sale, initially set for October 20, 2011, took place on November 3, 2011, for $9,600, less than the minimum bid of $14,850. Wells Fargo then sent a Deficiency Notice, including $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and fees, but later dismissed the case. The Plaintiffs then filed a class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also claimed breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nThe Plaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\n\n---\n\n#### Legal Issues:\n\n**I. Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. The complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\n\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\nWells Fargo argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\n\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nWells Fargo claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nWells Fargo cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nWells Fargo argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations.\n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nWells Fargo contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nWells Fargo sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees.

Ohio 2012)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio  \n**Date Filed:** October 17, 2012  \n**Precedential Status:** Precedential  \n**Citation:** 904 F. Supp. 2d 756, 78 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (West) 942, 2012 WL 4958516, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149233  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \n**Presiding Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster\n\n---\n\n#### Background:\n\nOn October 24, 2008, Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio, financing it through a Retail Installment Sales Contract assigned to Wells Fargo. The contract was governed by federal and Ohio law.\n\nIn the event of a default, Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nAfter the Plaintiffs defaulted in September 2011, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\n\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\n\n---\n\n#### Legal Issues:\n\n**I. Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\n\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\n\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations.\n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees.

JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections."},

Supp. 2d 756 (N.D.

LEXIS 149233  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \n**Presiding Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster\n\n---\n\n#### Background:\n\nOn October 24, 2008, Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio, financing it through a Retail Installment Sales Contract assigned to Wells Fargo. The contract was governed by federal and Ohio law.\n\nIn the event of a default, Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nAfter the Plaintiffs defaulted in September 2011, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\n\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\n\n---\n\n#### Legal Issues:\n\n**I. Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\n\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\n\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v.

Wells Fargo Bank NA*, 297 F.R.D. 665 (M.D. Fla. 2014)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Middle District of Florida  \n**Filed:** March 26, 2014  \n**Citation:** 297 F.R.D. 665, 2014 WL 1246494  \n**Docket Number:** No. 2:11-cv-695-FtM-29DNF  \n**Judge:** Douglas N. Frazier\n\n#### Background\n\nPlaintiffs Franz Lesti and Petra Richter filed a Motion to Compel Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to produce information regarding Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs, a co-conspirator. The Plaintiffs sought this information in relation to their claims involving alleged financial misconduct. The case revolves around the claim that Wells Fargo facilitated illicit transactions by allowing Fuchs to transfer money from accounts associated with her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts after allegedly discovering suspicious activity.\n\n#### Key Facts\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Request:** The Plaintiffs requested all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, emphasizing the need to understand Wells Fargo's conduct in opening accounts for her, particularly in light of accusations of money laundering.\n\n2. **Defendant's Response:** Wells Fargo objected to the request, citing several reasons:\n   - The request was overly broad and burdensome.\n   - The documents were irrelevant to the case and not likely to lead to admissible evidence.\n   - Assertions of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were made.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were routine and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo claimed that certain documents were protected under the SAR privilege, which prevents the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court noted that supporting documentation generated in the ordinary course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Findings\n\n- The Court ruled that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were relevant and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It limited the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while protecting the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\n- The Court required Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not obligating them to disclose privileged communications.\n\n#### Orders\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **GRANTED IN PART** and **DENIED IN PART**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\n\n2. The Court declined to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Principles\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court emphasized that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The burden of proving a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court distinguished between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\n\nThis ruling underscores the broad scope of discovery in civil litigation while balancing the need for confidentiality in banking operations."},

The Plaintiffs sought this information in connection to their allegations of financial wrongdoing. The lawsuit centers around the allegation that Wells Fargo enabled unlawful transactions by permitting Fuchs to move funds from accounts associated with her business, PCOM, to her personal accounts, even after allegedly detecting suspicious activity.\n\n#### Significant Facts\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Petition:** The Plaintiffs sought all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, highlighting the necessity to comprehend Wells Fargo's actions in establishing accounts for her, especially in the context of money laundering allegations.\n\n2. **Defendant's Position:** Wells Fargo opposed the request, citing several reasons:\n   - The request was excessively broad and onerous.\n   - The documents were not pertinent to the case and unlikely to lead to admissible evidence.\n   - Claims of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were raised.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts under scrutiny were standard and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo asserted that certain documents were safeguarded under the SAR privilege, which prohibits the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court pointed out that supporting documentation created in the normal course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Decisions\n\n- The Court determined that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were pertinent and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It narrowed the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while preserving the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\n- The Court mandated Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not compelling them to disclose privileged communications.\n\n#### Court Orders\n\n1.

The Court chose not to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Applicable Law\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court stressed that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The responsibility of demonstrating a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents such as *Union Bank of California v.

Frazier\n\n#### Case Background\n\nFranz Lesti and Petra Richter, the Plaintiffs, filed a motion to compel Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to provide information about Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs, an alleged co-conspirator. This information was sought in connection with their claims of financial misconduct. The case centered around the allegation that Wells Fargo enabled illicit transactions by allowing Fuchs to transfer funds from accounts associated with her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts, despite allegedly detecting suspicious activity.\n\n#### Key Details\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Motion:** The Plaintiffs sought all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, emphasizing the need to comprehend Wells Fargo's actions in opening accounts for her, particularly considering the allegations of money laundering.\n\n2. **Defendant's Opposition:** Wells Fargo objected to the request, stating:\n   - The request was too broad and burdensome.\n   - The documents were irrelevant and unlikely to lead to admissible evidence.\n   - The bank asserted attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine.\n   - Wells Fargo argued that the accounts in question were routine and closed shortly after opening, suggesting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo asserted that certain documents were protected under the SAR privilege, which prohibits the disclosure of SARs or information revealing their existence. However, the Court noted that supporting documentation generated in the normal course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Conclusions\n\n- The Court determined that the documents related to Fuchs' accounts were relevant and could potentially lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It limited the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while safeguarding the SAR privilege for drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\n- The Court ordered Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\u2019 accounts but did not compel them to disclose privileged communications.\n\n#### Court Orders\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **PARTIALLY GRANTED** and **PARTIALLY DENIED**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\n\n2. The Court decided not to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Standards\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court emphasized that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The burden of proving a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following cases like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v.

The case hinges on the allegation that Wells Fargo enabled unlawful transactions by permitting Fuchs to transfer funds from accounts linked to her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts, despite purportedly detecting dubious activity.\n\n#### Pivotal Details\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Motion:** The Plaintiffs sought all documents concerning Angelika Neumeier, stressing the necessity of comprehending Wells Fargo's actions in opening accounts for her, especially considering the allegations of money laundering.\n\n2. **Defendant's Position:** Wells Fargo contested the motion, offering several justifications:\n   - The motion was excessively broad and onerous.\n   - The documents were immaterial to the case and unlikely to yield admissible evidence.\n   - Claims of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were invoked.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were standard and closed shortly after opening, suggesting that the Plaintiffs could have procured information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Protection:** Wells Fargo asserted that certain documents were shielded by the SAR privilege, which prohibits the disclosure of SARs or information revealing their existence. However, the Court pointed out that supporting documentation created in the normal course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Conclusions\n\n- The Court determined that the documents pertaining to Fuchs' accounts were pertinent and could potentially uncover admissible evidence. It restricted the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while safeguarding the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal discussions related to them.\n- The Court mandated Wells Fargo to produce business records related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not compelling them to reveal privileged communications.\n\n#### Court Orders\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **GRANTED IN PART** and **DENIED IN PART**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was directed to furnish specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had secured a waiver following the depositions.\n\n2. The Court decided against awarding any penalties or fees to the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Standards\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court highlighted that pertinent information is discoverable, even if it is not directly admissible in court. The onus of demonstrating a lack of relevance falls on the party objecting to the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court differentiated between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\n\nThis decision underscores the extensive scope of discovery in civil litigation while maintaining the necessity for confidentiality in banking operations."},

The case centers around the allegation that Wells Fargo facilitated illicit transactions by permitting Fuchs to transfer funds from accounts linked to her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts following the discovery of suspicious activity.\n\n#### Significant Facts\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Motion:** The Plaintiffs sought all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, stressing the importance of understanding Wells Fargo's actions in opening accounts for her, given the allegations of money laundering.\n\n2. **Defendant's Opposition:** Wells Fargo objected to the motion, citing various reasons:\n   - The motion was excessively broad and burdensome.\n   - The documents were irrelevant and unlikely to yield admissible evidence.\n   - Claims of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were invoked.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were ordinary and closed shortly after opening, contending that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo asserted that certain documents were shielded by the SAR privilege, which prevents the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court noted that supporting documentation created in the regular course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Conclusions\n\n- The Court determined that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were relevant and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It restricted the scope of the motion to factual documents, such as transaction records, while preserving the SAR privilege concerning drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\n- The Court mandated Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not compelling them to disclose privileged communications.\n\n#### Rulings\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **PARTIALLY GRANTED** and **PARTIALLY DENIED**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\n\n2. The Court declined to impose any sanctions or fees on the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Doctrines\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court highlighted that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The onus of proving a lack of relevance lies with the party opposing the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court differentiated between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\n\nThis decision emphasizes the expansive nature of discovery in civil litigation while balancing the necessity for confidentiality in banking operations."},

The case arose following Bailey's Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing on November 9, 2009, after Wells Fargo conducted a foreclosure sale on October 23, 2009.\n\n#### Relevant Case Facts\n\n1. **Mortgage Origin**: In 1992, Bailey obtained a $104,000 mortgage from Shawmut Mortgage Company for her property in Hudson, Massachusetts.  \n2. **Foreclosure Actions**: After Bailey defaulted on her mortgage payments in late 2008, Wells Fargo filed a petition to foreclose on the property, claiming to be the mortgage holder.  \n3. **Foreclosure Sale**: The property was sold to a third party during the foreclosure process.  \n4. **Adversary Proceeding**: Bailey filed an adversary complaint against Wells Fargo on November 23, 2009, claiming the foreclosure was invalid due to Wells Fargo\u2019s lack of holder status.\n\n#### Claims in the Complaint\n\nBailey\u2019s five-count complaint included:\n\n1. **Count I**: Declaratory Judgment - Bailey sought to declare the foreclosure invalid based on Wells Fargo's failure to prove it was the mortgage holder.\n2. **Count II**: Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing - Alleging Wells Fargo acted carelessly regarding the custody of mortgage documents.\n3. **Count III**: Infliction of Emotional Distress - Claiming Wells Fargo's actions caused her extreme emotional distress.\n4. **Count IV**: Unjust Enrichment - Arguing that Wells Fargo was unjustly enriched by accepting payments without holding the mortgage.\n5. **Count V**: Violations of Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute (G.L. c. 93A) - Claiming Wells Fargo engaged in unfair and deceptive practices.\n\n#### Positions of the Parties\n\n- **Debtor\u2019s Argument**: Bailey contended that because there was no recorded transfer of the mortgage from Shawmut to Washington Mutual (the entity that assigned the mortgage to Wells Fargo), the foreclosure was invalid. She relied on precedents like *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v. Ibanez* and *In re Schwartz* to support her claims.\n  \n- **Defendant\u2019s Argument**: Wells Fargo argued that the mortgage was validly transferred through off-record mergers and that recording is not a strict requirement under Massachusetts law. They asserted that they held the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, citing a chain of title.\n\n#### Court\u2019s Analysis\n\n1. **Motion to Dismiss Standard**: The court applied the standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), emphasizing that allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true, and reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\n\n2. **Count I: Declaratory Judgment**: The court found Bailey adequately alleged that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, thus denying the motion to dismiss this count. The court distinguished the requirements of holder status from perfect record title, affirming that the absence of a clear chain of title could invalidate the foreclosure.\n\n3. **Count II: Breach of Implied Covenant**: The court granted the motion to dismiss this count, reasoning that if Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage, there was no contract to breach. Additionally, no bad faith or unethical conduct was sufficiently alleged.\n\n4. **Count III: Infliction of Emotional Distress**: The court dismissed this count, stating that Bailey failed to establish extreme and outrageous conduct by Wells Fargo necessary for intentional infliction claims. Negligent infliction claims failed due to the lack of physical harm.\n\n5. **Count IV: Unjust Enrichment**: The court dismissed this count on the grounds that Bailey would be unjustly enriched if any payments to Wells Fargo were returned, as she was obligated to pay someone under the mortgage.\n\n6. **Count V: Chapter 93A**: The court dismissed this count, finding no factual basis to support claims of unfair or deceptive practices by Wells Fargo.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe court denied Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss for Count I (declaratory judgment) but granted it for Counts II through V. Thus, the case centered on whether Wells Fargo had the legitimate authority to foreclose, raising significant issues about mortgage holder status and the implications of Massachusetts foreclosure law.\n\n### Key Case Law and Authorities Cited\n\n- *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v.

Bailey, the Debtor, initiated an adversary proceeding against Wells Fargo Bank, NA, seeking to invalidate a foreclosure on her property, claiming that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage at the time of the foreclosure sale. The case arose following Bailey's Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing on November 9, 2009, after Wells Fargo conducted a foreclosure sale on October 23, 2009.\n\n#### Relevant Case Facts\n\n1. **Mortgage Origin**: In 1992, Bailey obtained a $104,000 mortgage from Shawmut Mortgage Company for her property in Hudson, Massachusetts.  \n2. **Foreclosure Actions**: After Bailey defaulted on her mortgage payments in late 2008, Wells Fargo filed a petition to foreclose on the property, claiming to be the mortgage holder.  \n3. **Foreclosure Sale**: The property was sold to a third party during the foreclosure process.  \n4. **Adversary Proceeding**: Bailey filed an adversary complaint against Wells Fargo on November 23, 2009, claiming the foreclosure was invalid due to Wells Fargo\u2019s lack of holder status.\n\n#### Claims in the Complaint\n\nBailey\u2019s five-count complaint included:\n\n1. **Count I**: Declaratory Judgment - Bailey sought to declare the foreclosure invalid based on Wells Fargo's failure to prove it was the mortgage holder.\n2. **Count II**: Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing - Alleging Wells Fargo acted carelessly regarding the custody of mortgage documents.\n3. **Count III**: Infliction of Emotional Distress - Claiming Wells Fargo's actions caused her extreme emotional distress.\n4. **Count IV**: Unjust Enrichment - Arguing that Wells Fargo was unjustly enriched by accepting payments without holding the mortgage.\n5. **Count V**: Violations of Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute (G.L. c. 93A) - Claiming Wells Fargo engaged in unfair and deceptive practices.\n\n#### Positions of the Parties\n\n- **Debtor\u2019s Argument**: Bailey contended that because there was no recorded transfer of the mortgage from Shawmut to Washington Mutual (the entity that assigned the mortgage to Wells Fargo), the foreclosure was invalid. She relied on precedents like *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v. Ibanez* and *In re Schwartz* to support her claims.\n  \n- **Defendant\u2019s Argument**: Wells Fargo argued that the mortgage was validly transferred through off-record mergers and that recording is not a strict requirement under Massachusetts law. They asserted that they held the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, citing a chain of title.\n\n#### Court\u2019s Analysis\n\n1. **Motion to Dismiss Standard**: The court applied the standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), emphasizing that allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true, and reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\n\n2. **Count I: Declaratory Judgment**: The court found Bailey adequately alleged that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, thus denying the motion to dismiss this count. The court distinguished the requirements of holder status from perfect record title, affirming that the absence of a clear chain of title could invalidate the foreclosure.\n\n3. **Count II: Breach of Implied Covenant**: The court granted the motion to dismiss this count, reasoning that if Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage, there was no contract to breach. Additionally, no bad faith or unethical conduct was sufficiently alleged.\n\n4. **Count III: Infliction of Emotional Distress**: The court dismissed this count, stating that Bailey failed to establish extreme and outrageous conduct by Wells Fargo necessary for intentional infliction claims. Negligent infliction claims failed due to the lack of physical harm.\n\n5. **Count IV: Unjust Enrichment**: The court dismissed this count on the grounds that Bailey would be unjustly enriched if any payments to Wells Fargo were returned, as she was obligated to pay someone under the mortgage.\n\n6. **Count V: Chapter 93A**: The court dismissed this count, finding no factual basis to support claims of unfair or deceptive practices by Wells Fargo.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe court denied Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss for Count I (declaratory judgment) but granted it for Counts II through V.

Bailey initiated an adversary proceeding against Wells Fargo, alleging that the bank was not the rightful holder of the mortgage at the time of the foreclosure sale.\n\n#### Pertinent Case Facts\n\n1. **Mortgage Origin**: Bailey acquired a $104,000 mortgage from Shawmut Mortgage Company in 1992 for her Hudson, Massachusetts property.  \n2. **Foreclosure Initiation**: Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure petition against Bailey's property in late 2008, following her default on mortgage payments.  \n3. **Foreclosure Sale**: The property was sold to a third party during the foreclosure process.  \n4. **Adversary Proceeding**: Bailey filed a complaint against Wells Fargo on November 23, 2009, claiming the foreclosure was invalid due to Wells Fargo's lack of holder status.\n\n#### Complaint Allegations\n\nBailey's complaint included five counts:\n\n1. **Count I**: Declaratory Judgment - Bailey sought to invalidate the foreclosure due to Wells Fargo's inability to prove it was the mortgage holder.\n2. **Count II**: Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing - Bailey alleged that Wells Fargo acted negligently regarding the safekeeping of mortgage documents.\n3. **Count III**: Infliction of Emotional Distress - Bailey claimed that Wells Fargo's actions caused her severe emotional distress.\n4. **Count IV**: Unjust Enrichment - Bailey argued that Wells Fargo was unjustly enriched by accepting payments without holding the mortgage.\n5. **Count V**: Violations of Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute (G.L. c. 93A) - Bailey claimed that Wells Fargo engaged in deceptive and unfair practices.\n\n#### Party Positions\n\n- **Plaintiff\u2019s Argument**: Bailey argued that because there was no recorded transfer of the mortgage from Shawmut to Washington Mutual (the entity that assigned the mortgage to Wells Fargo), the foreclosure was invalid. She relied on precedents such as *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v. Ibanez* and *In re Schwartz* to support her claims.\n  \n- **Defendant\u2019s Argument**: Wells Fargo contended that the mortgage was validly transferred through unrecorded mergers and that recording is not a strict requirement under Massachusetts law. They asserted that they held the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, citing a chain of title.\n\n#### Court\u2019s Analysis\n\n1. **Motion to Dismiss Standard**: The court applied the standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), emphasizing that allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true, and reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\n\n2. **Count I: Declaratory Judgment**: The court found Bailey adequately alleged that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, thus denying the motion to dismiss this count. The court distinguished the requirements of holder status from perfect record title, affirming that the absence of a clear chain of title could invalidate the foreclosure.\n\n3. **Count II: Breach of Implied Covenant**: The court granted the motion to dismiss this count, reasoning that if Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage, there was no contract to breach. Additionally, no bad faith or unethical conduct was sufficiently alleged.\n\n4. **Count III: Infliction of Emotional Distress**: The court dismissed this count, stating that Bailey failed to establish extreme and outrageous conduct by Wells Fargo necessary for intentional infliction claims. Negligent infliction claims failed due to the lack of physical harm.\n\n5. **Count IV: Unjust Enrichment**: The court dismissed this count on the grounds that Bailey would be unjustly enriched if any payments to Wells Fargo were returned, as she was obligated to pay someone under the mortgage.\n\n6. **Count V: Chapter 93A**: The court dismissed this count, finding no factual basis to support claims of unfair or deceptive practices by Wells Fargo.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe court denied Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss for Count I (declaratory judgment) but granted it for Counts II through V. The case revolved around whether Wells Fargo had the legitimate authority to foreclose, raising significant issues about mortgage holder status and the implications of Massachusetts foreclosure law.\n\n#### Notable Case Law and Authorities Cited\n\n- *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v.

Negligent infliction claims failed due to the lack of physical harm.\n\n5. **Count IV: Unjust Enrichment**: The court dismissed this count on the grounds that Bailey would be unjustly enriched if any payments to Wells Fargo were returned, as she was obligated to pay someone under the mortgage.\n\n6. **Count V: Chapter 93A**: The court dismissed this count, finding no factual basis to support claims of unfair or deceptive practices by Wells Fargo.\n\n#### Final Outcome\n\nThe court denied Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss for Count I (declaratory judgment) but granted it for Counts II through V. Thus, the case focused on whether Wells Fargo had the legitimate authority to foreclose, raising significant issues about mortgage holder status and the implications of Massachusetts foreclosure law.\n\n### Significant Case Law and Authorities Cited\n\n- *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v.

Wells Fargo Bank, NA (In Re Bailey)*, 437 B.R. 721 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2010)\n\n**Court:** United States Bankruptcy Court, D. Massachusetts  \n**Filed:** September 29, 2010  \n**Citation:** 437 B.R. 721, 2010 WL 3927491  \n**Docket Number:** 19-10346  \n**Judge:** Henry J. Boroff\n\n#### Background\n\nCarmen M. Bailey, the plaintiff, filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on November 9, 2009, after Wells Fargo Bank, NA, conducted a foreclosure sale on her property on October 23, 2009. Bailey initiated an adversary proceeding against Wells Fargo, alleging that the bank was not the rightful holder of the mortgage at the time of the foreclosure sale.\n\n#### Pertinent Case Facts\n\n1. **Mortgage Origin**: Bailey acquired a $104,000 mortgage from Shawmut Mortgage Company in 1992 for her Hudson, Massachusetts property.  \n2. **Foreclosure Initiation**: Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure petition against Bailey's property in late 2008, following her default on mortgage payments.  \n3. **Foreclosure Sale**: The property was sold to a third party during the foreclosure process.  \n4. **Adversary Proceeding**: Bailey filed a complaint against Wells Fargo on November 23, 2009, claiming the foreclosure was invalid due to Wells Fargo's lack of holder status.\n\n#### Complaint Allegations\n\nBailey's complaint included five counts:\n\n1. **Count I**: Declaratory Judgment - Bailey sought to invalidate the foreclosure due to Wells Fargo's inability to prove it was the mortgage holder.\n2. **Count II**: Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing - Bailey alleged that Wells Fargo acted negligently regarding the safekeeping of mortgage documents.\n3. **Count III**: Infliction of Emotional Distress - Bailey claimed that Wells Fargo's actions caused her severe emotional distress.\n4. **Count IV**: Unjust Enrichment - Bailey argued that Wells Fargo was unjustly enriched by accepting payments without holding the mortgage.\n5. **Count V**: Violations of Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute (G.L. c. 93A) - Bailey claimed that Wells Fargo engaged in deceptive and unfair practices.\n\n#### Party Positions\n\n- **Plaintiff\u2019s Argument**: Bailey argued that because there was no recorded transfer of the mortgage from Shawmut to Washington Mutual (the entity that assigned the mortgage to Wells Fargo), the foreclosure was invalid. She relied on precedents such as *U.S. Bank National Ass'n v. Ibanez* and *In re Schwartz* to support her claims.\n  \n- **Defendant\u2019s Argument**: Wells Fargo contended that the mortgage was validly transferred through unrecorded mergers and that recording is not a strict requirement under Massachusetts law. They asserted that they held the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, citing a chain of title.\n\n#### Court\u2019s Analysis\n\n1. **Motion to Dismiss Standard**: The court applied the standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), emphasizing that allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true, and reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\n\n2. **Count I: Declaratory Judgment**: The court found Bailey adequately alleged that Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage at the time of foreclosure, thus denying the motion to dismiss this count. The court distinguished the requirements of holder status from perfect record title, affirming that the absence of a clear chain of title could invalidate the foreclosure.\n\n3. **Count II: Breach of Implied Covenant**: The court granted the motion to dismiss this count, reasoning that if Wells Fargo was not the holder of the mortgage, there was no contract to breach. Additionally, no bad faith or unethical conduct was sufficiently alleged.\n\n4. **Count III: Infliction of Emotional Distress**: The court dismissed this count, stating that Bailey failed to establish extreme and outrageous conduct by Wells Fargo necessary for intentional infliction claims.

Ohio 2013)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio  \n**Filed:** January 4, 2013  \n**Citation:** 916 F. Supp. 2d 839, 2013 WL 65439  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. 2:12-cv-467  \n**Judge:** Gregory L. Frost\n\n#### Background\n\nPlaintiff Robert S. Blake filed a complaint on May 30, 2012, against multiple defendants, including Wells Fargo Bank, NA, associated with a mortgage transaction for his principal dwelling in Westerville, Ohio. Blake executed a promissory note and mortgage on December 1, 2009, with Century Mortgage Company as the lender and APR Mortgage Corporation as the broker.\n\n#### Allegations Against Wells Fargo\n\nAlthough the primary focus of the complaint was on Century, Landstar Title, and Prominent Title, Wells Fargo was implicated due to its status as the current holder of the note and mortgage:\n\n1. **Illegal Kickbacks**: Blake alleged that Century, APR, Landstar, and Prominent were engaged in an affiliate relationship that resulted in illegal kickbacks in violation of **12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(a)**, which prohibits such practices in federally related mortgage loans.\n\n2. **Truth in Lending Act (TILA) Violations**: Blake claimed that the illegal kickbacks should have been included in the calculation of the finance charge for his mortgage loan, which violated the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq.) and Regulation Z (15 C.F.R. pt. 226).\n\n3. **Fifth Count - Civil Aiding and Abetting**: Blake alleged that Century, Landstar, and Prominent had civil liability for aiding and abetting APR\u2019s unlawful conduct related to the mortgage transaction. He argued they knew of the illegal kickbacks and shared in the profits, making them jointly liable.\n\n#### Motions to Dismiss\n\n- **Wells Fargo's Motion**: Although the text does not detail Wells Fargo's specific arguments, it indicated that Wells Fargo sought dismissal of Blake's claims, likely contesting the validity of the allegations based on its role as the holder of the mortgage.\n\n- **Other Defendants' Motions**: Century, Landstar, and Prominent filed motions arguing that Ohio law does not recognize a claim for civil aiding and abetting. They contended that Blake failed to state a valid claim as a matter of law.\n\n#### Court's Analysis\n\n1. **Civil Aiding and Abetting**: The court reviewed the legal standards for civil aiding and abetting claims under Ohio law, referencing the **Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 876**, which outlines the requirements for such claims.\n\n2. **Key Case Law**:\n   - **Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Leahey Const. Co.**, 219 F.3d 519 (6th Cir. 2000): The Sixth Circuit suggested that Ohio might recognize aiding and abetting claims, but this was called into question by more recent rulings.\n   - **DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass\u2019n, Inc.**, 132 Ohio St.3d 516, 974 N.E.2d 1194 (2012): The Supreme Court of Ohio explicitly held that it does not recognize a cause of action for civil aiding and abetting, undermining previous implications by the Sixth Circuit.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The court concluded that, based on *DeVries Dairy*, the claim for civil aiding and abetting was not valid under Ohio law. Therefore, the court granted the motions to dismiss from Century, Landstar, and Prominent, effectively terminating these defendants from the action.\n\n#### Final Order\n\nThe court ordered the dismissal of Century Mortgage Company, Landstar Title, LLC, and Prominent Title Agency, LLC from the case, leaving Wells Fargo as a continuing defendant based on its role as the holder of the mortgage.\n\n### Key Authorities Cited\n\n- **12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(a)**: Prohibits kickbacks in real estate settlement services.\n- **Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq.)**: Governs disclosures related to the finance charges on loans.\n- **Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 876**: Details conditions for liability in aiding and abetting tortious conduct.\n- **Aetna Cas. & Sur.

They argued that Blake had not presented a valid claim as a matter of law.\n\n#### Court's Evaluation\n\n1. **Civil Aiding and Abetting**: The court examined the legal standards for civil aiding and abetting claims under Ohio law, referencing the **Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 876**, which sets out the requirements for such claims.\n\n2. **Pivotal Case Law**:\n   - **Aetna Cas. & Sur.

Blake's allegations against Wells Fargo were:\n\n1. **Unlawful Kickbacks**: Blake contended that Century, APR, Landstar, and Prominent were involved in an illegal affiliate relationship that resulted in prohibited kickbacks, violating **12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(a)**, which forbids such practices in federally related mortgage loans.\n\n2. **Truth in Lending Act (TILA) Violations**: Blake argued that the illegal kickbacks should have been incorporated into the finance charge for his mortgage loan, thereby breaching the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq.) and Regulation Z (15 C.F.R. pt. 226).\n\n3. **Fifth Count - Civil Aiding and Abetting**: Blake asserted that Century, Landstar, and Prominent were liable for civilly aiding and abetting APR\u2019s unlawful conduct related to the mortgage transaction. He claimed they were aware of the illegal kickbacks and benefited from them, making them jointly responsible.\n\n#### Motions to Dismiss\n\n- **Wells Fargo's Motion**: Although the text does not elaborate on Wells Fargo's specific arguments, it indicates that Wells Fargo sought dismissal of Blake's claims, likely disputing the validity of the allegations based on its role as the holder of the mortgage.\n\n- **Other Defendants' Motions**: Century, Landstar, and Prominent filed motions arguing that Ohio law does not recognize a claim for civil aiding and abetting. They argued that Blake had not presented a valid claim as a matter of law.\n\n#### Court's Evaluation\n\n1. **Civil Aiding and Abetting**: The court examined the legal standards for civil aiding and abetting claims under Ohio law, referencing the **Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 876**, which sets out the requirements for such claims.\n\n2. **Pivotal Case Law**:\n   - **Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Leahey Const. Co.**, 219 F.3d 519 (6th Cir. 2000): The Sixth Circuit suggested that Ohio might acknowledge aiding and abetting claims, but this was challenged by subsequent rulings.\n   - **DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass\u2019n, Inc.**, 132 Ohio St.3d 516, 974 N.E.2d 1194 (2012): The Supreme Court of Ohio explicitly ruled that it does not recognize a cause of action for civil aiding and abetting, overturning previous implications by the Sixth Circuit.\n\n3. **Decision**: Based on *DeVries Dairy*, the court determined that the claim for civil aiding and abetting was not valid under Ohio law. Consequently, the court granted the motions to dismiss from Century, Landstar, and Prominent, effectively removing these defendants from the lawsuit.\n\n#### Final Judgment\n\nThe court ordered the dismissal of Century Mortgage Company, Landstar Title, LLC, and Prominent Title Agency, LLC from the case, leaving Wells Fargo as the remaining defendant due to its role as the holder of the mortgage.\n\n### Notable Legal Precedents\n\n- **12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(a)**: Prohibits kickbacks in real estate settlement services.\n- **Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq.)**: Regulates disclosures related to the finance charges on loans.\n- **Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 876**: Outlines conditions for liability in aiding and abetting tortious conduct.\n- **Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Leahey Const. Co.**, 219 F.3d 519 (6th Cir. 2000): Discussed the potential recognition of aiding and abetting in Ohio.\n- **DeVries Dairy, L.L.C. v. White Eagle Coop. Ass\u2019n, Inc.**, 132 Ohio St.3d 516, 974 N.E.2d 1194 (2012): Clarified that Ohio does not recognize civil aiding and abetting claims.\n\nThis summary encapsulates the main aspects of the case related to Wells Fargo, including the complaints against it, relevant legal theories, and the court's conclusions."},

# Garcia v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA (C.D. Cal. 2014): Issue 1: bank's BS claims to remove a case to federal court:

{"input": "Challenge a bank's removal to federal court of a case I filed in state court:", "output": "### Summary of *Garcia v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA*, 990 F. Supp. 2d 1028 (C.D. Cal. 2014)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Central District of California  \n**Filed:** January 3, 2014  \n**Citation:** 990 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 2014 WL 29354  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. CV 13-9325 FMO (SHx)  \n**Judge:** Fernando M. Olguin  \n\n#### Introduction\n\nPlaintiffs Rafael Garcia and Martha C. Garcia filed a complaint against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (WFB) and other defendants, alleging violations of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights concerning 'dual tracking' of their mortgage. The case was first filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and later removed to federal court by WFB on the grounds of diversity jurisdiction.\n\n#### Background Facts\n\n1. **Loan Modification Negotiations**: The plaintiffs were negotiating with WFB to obtain a modification for their home loan related to their property at 17129 Leal Ave., Cerritos, California. They alleged that while these negotiations were ongoing, WFB initiated foreclosure proceedings against their home.\n\n2. **Claims of Dual Tracking**: The plaintiffs accused WFB of engaging in dual tracking, which is the practice of pursuing foreclosure while simultaneously reviewing a loan modification application. This practice is prohibited under California law.\n\n3. **Lack of Communication**: They claimed WFB failed to provide a single point of contact, contrary to the requirements of California law, resulting in them being transferred among different representatives.\n\n4. **Notice of Trustee\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing negotiations.\n\n#### Removal to Federal Court\n\nWFB removed the case to federal court, asserting diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, claiming that:\n- Plaintiffs are citizens of California.\n- WFB is a citizen of South Dakota.\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a citizen of multiple states including Delaware and Texas.\n\n#### Legal Standards\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, federal courts have jurisdiction over civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the parties are citizens of different states. The removal statute is strictly construed against removal.\n\n2. **Corporate Citizenship**: A corporation is a citizen of its state of incorporation and the state where its principal place of business is located. For national banks, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348 provides that they are citizens of the states in which they are 'located.'\n\n#### Jurisdictional Analysis\n\n1. **National Banking Association**: The court examined whether WFB, as a national bank, is a citizen of both South Dakota (where its main office is located) and California (where the plaintiffs reside).\n\n2. **Definitions of 'Located'**: The term \u201clocated\u201d has been interpreted variously:\n   - Main office location.\n   - Branch locations.\n   - Principal place of business.\n\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**: \n   - In *Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt*, the Supreme Court confirmed that a national bank is a citizen of the state of its main office.\n   - Courts have generally ruled that a national bank may be considered a citizen of both its main office and principal place of business.\n\n#### Court's Decision\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Unavailable**: The court determined that WFB is a citizen of both California and South Dakota, thereby negating complete diversity. As a result, the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Remand to State Court**: The court ordered the case remanded to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).\n\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions were denied as moot due to the remand.\n\n### Summary of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights\n\nThe California Homeowner Bill of Rights became law on January 1, 2013, with many provisions renewed and modified as of January 1, 2019. It aims to protect homeowners facing foreclosure, particularly with respect to dual tracking and loan modifications.\n\n#### Key Provisions\n\n1. **Notification of Foreclosure-Prevention Options**: Servicers must contact homeowners at least 30 days before starting foreclosure to discuss options. They must also provide information regarding alternatives to avoid foreclosure after recording a notice of default.\n\n2. **Guaranteed Single Point of Contact**: Homeowners must be assigned a specific representative to guide them through the loan modification process.\n\n3. **Acknowledgment of Application**: Servicers must notify homeowners of any missing information or errors in their loan modification applications within five business days.\n\n4. **Restrictions on Fees**: Homeowners cannot be charged fees for applying for a loan modification and cannot incur late fees while the servicer is reviewing their application.\n\n5. **Restrictions on Dual Tracking**: The foreclosure process must be paused while a loan modification application is under review, and foreclosure cannot proceed while homeowners comply with an approved modification plan.\n\n6. **Denial Rights**: If a loan modification is denied, the servicer must provide written reasons and allow homeowners to appeal the decision.\n\n7. **Transfer Rights**: If a loan modification is approved and the loan is sold or transferred, the new servicer must honor the existing modification.\n\n8. **Verification of Documents**: Servicers must ensure that foreclosure documents are accurate and supported by reliable evidence.\n\n9. **Tenant Rights**: Purchasers of foreclosed homes must provide tenants with at least 90 days before starting eviction proceedings and must honor existing leases in certain circumstances.\n\n#### Application and Enforcement\n\nThe Homeowner Bill of Rights applies to first-lien mortgages on owner-occupied homes with no more than four units. Homeowners who believe their rights have been violated may seek legal assistance and report violations to relevant state authorities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe court's ruling in *Garcia v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA* revolved around the determination of WFB's citizenship for diversity jurisdiction purposes, ultimately leading to a remand to state court. Concurrently, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights provides robust protections for homeowners against foreclosure practices, ensuring that lenders comply with specific protocols during the loan modification process."},

For national banks, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348 provides that they are residents of the states in which they are 'located.'\n\n#### Jurisdictional Evaluation\n\n1. **National Banking Association**: The court assessed whether WFB, as a national bank, is a resident of both South Dakota (where its main office is located) and California (where the plaintiffs reside).\n\n2. **Definitions of 'Located'**: The term \u201clocated\u201d has been interpreted in various ways:\n   - Main office location.\n   - Branch locations.\n   - Principal place of business.\n\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**:\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v.

As a result, the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Return to State Court**: The court ordered the case returned to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).\n\n3. **Dismissal of Pending Motions**: All pending motions were dismissed as moot due to the return.\n\n### Summary of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights\n\nThe California Homeowner Bill of Rights became law on January 1, 2013, with many provisions renewed and modified as of January 1, 2019. It aims to safeguard homeowners facing foreclosure, particularly with respect to dual tracking and loan modifications.\n\n#### Key Elements\n\n1. **Notification of Foreclosure-Prevention Options**: Servicers must contact homeowners at least 30 days before starting foreclosure to discuss options. They must also provide information regarding alternatives to avoid foreclosure after recording a notice of default.\n\n2. **Guaranteed Single Point of Contact**: Homeowners must be assigned a specific representative to guide them through the loan modification process.\n\n3. **Acknowledgment of Application**: Servicers must notify homeowners of any missing information or errors in their loan modification applications within five business days.\n\n4. **Restrictions on Fees**: Homeowners cannot be charged fees for applying for a loan modification and cannot incur late fees while the servicer is reviewing their application.\n\n5. **Restrictions on Dual Tracking**: The foreclosure process must be paused while a loan modification application is under review, and foreclosure cannot proceed while homeowners comply with an approved modification plan.\n\n6. **Denial Rights**: If a loan modification is denied, the servicer must provide written reasons and allow homeowners to appeal the decision.\n\n7. **Transfer Rights**: If a loan modification is approved and the loan is sold or transferred, the new servicer must honor the existing modification.\n\n8. **Verification of Documents**: Servicers must ensure that foreclosure documents are accurate and supported by reliable evidence.\n\n9. **Tenant Rights**: Purchasers of foreclosed homes must provide tenants with at least 90 days before starting eviction proceedings and must honor existing leases in certain circumstances.\n\n#### Implementation and Enforcement\n\nThe Homeowner Bill of Rights applies to first-lien mortgages on owner-occupied homes with no more than four units. Homeowners who believe their rights have been violated may seek legal assistance and report violations to relevant state authorities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe court's decision in *Garcia v.

This practice is prohibited by California law.\n\n3. **Inadequate Communication**: They asserted that WFB failed to provide a single point of contact, contrary to the requirements of California law, causing them to be transferred among various representatives.\n\n4. **Notice of Trustee\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing negotiations.\n\n#### Transfer to Federal Court\n\nWFB moved the case to federal court, asserting diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, claiming that:\n- Plaintiffs are California residents.\n- WFB is a South Dakota resident.\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a resident of multiple states, including Delaware and Texas.\n\n#### Legal Principles\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, federal courts have jurisdiction over civil actions where the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 and the parties are residents of different states. The removal statute is strictly interpreted against removal.\n\n2. **Corporate Residency**: A corporation is a resident of its state of incorporation and the state where its principal place of business is located. For national banks, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348 provides that they are residents of the states in which they are 'located.'\n\n#### Jurisdictional Evaluation\n\n1. **National Banking Association**: The court assessed whether WFB, as a national bank, is a resident of both South Dakota (where its main office is located) and California (where the plaintiffs reside).\n\n2. **Definitions of 'Located'**: The term \u201clocated\u201d has been interpreted in various ways:\n   - Main office location.\n   - Branch locations.\n   - Principal place of business.\n\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**:\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt*, the Supreme Court confirmed that a national bank is a resident of the state of its main office.\n   - Courts have generally ruled that a national bank may be considered a resident of both its main office and principal place of business.\n\n#### Court's Ruling\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Not Applicable**: The court determined that WFB is a resident of both California and South Dakota, thereby negating complete diversity. As a result, the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Return to State Court**: The court ordered the case returned to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).\n\n3. **Dismissal of Pending Motions**: All pending motions were dismissed as moot due to the return.\n\n### Summary of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights\n\nThe California Homeowner Bill of Rights became law on January 1, 2013, with many provisions renewed and modified as of January 1, 2019. It aims to safeguard homeowners facing foreclosure, particularly with respect to dual tracking and loan modifications.\n\n#### Key Elements\n\n1. **Notification of Foreclosure-Prevention Options**: Servicers must contact homeowners at least 30 days before starting foreclosure to discuss options. They must also provide information regarding alternatives to avoid foreclosure after recording a notice of default.\n\n2. **Guaranteed Single Point of Contact**: Homeowners must be assigned a specific representative to guide them through the loan modification process.\n\n3. **Acknowledgment of Application**: Servicers must notify homeowners of any missing information or errors in their loan modification applications within five business days.\n\n4. **Restrictions on Fees**: Homeowners cannot be charged fees for applying for a loan modification and cannot incur late fees while the servicer is reviewing their application.\n\n5. **Restrictions on Dual Tracking**: The foreclosure process must be paused while a loan modification application is under review, and foreclosure cannot proceed while homeowners comply with an approved modification plan.\n\n6. **Denial Rights**: If a loan modification is denied, the servicer must provide written reasons and allow homeowners to appeal the decision.\n\n7. **Transfer Rights**: If a loan modification is approved and the loan is sold or transferred, the new servicer must honor the existing modification.\n\n8. **Verification of Documents**: Servicers must ensure that foreclosure documents are accurate and supported by reliable evidence.\n\n9. **Tenant Rights**: Purchasers of foreclosed homes must provide tenants with at least 90 days before starting eviction proceedings and must honor existing leases in certain circumstances.\n\n#### Implementation and Enforcement\n\nThe Homeowner Bill of Rights applies to first-lien mortgages on owner-occupied homes with no more than four units. Homeowners who believe their rights have been violated may seek legal assistance and report violations to relevant state authorities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe court's decision in *Garcia v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA* hinged on the determination of WFB's residency for diversity jurisdiction purposes, ultimately leading to a return to state court. Simultaneously, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights offers strong protections for homeowners against foreclosure practices, ensuring that lenders adhere to specific procedures during the loan modification process."},

WFB claimed:\n- The plaintiffs are citizens of California.\n- WFB is a citizen of South Dakota.\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a citizen of Delaware, Texas, Michigan, and Minnesota.\n\n#### Legal Standards\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332**, federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the parties are citizens of different states. The removal statute is strictly construed against removal jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Corporate Citizenship**: A corporation is deemed a citizen of the state of incorporation and the state where its principal place of business is located. For national banks, **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348** provides that they are citizens of the states in which they are 'located.'\n\n#### Jurisdictional Analysis\n\n1. **National Banking Association**: WFB, as a national bank, is governed by a different jurisdictional provision. The court noted that WFB is a citizen of the state where its main office is located, as established in its articles of incorporation.\n\n2. **Definitions of 'Located'**: The term 'located' for national banks has been interpreted in various ways by courts:\n   - Where the bank has its main office.\n   - Where it has branches.\n   - Where its principal place of business is.\n\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**:\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v.

The Court did not resolve whether a bank could also be a citizen of the state where its principal place of business is located.\n   - Courts have generally recognized both definitions, leading to varying interpretations across circuits.\n\n#### Court's Decision\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Unavailable**: The court found that WFB is a citizen of both California and South Dakota. Since the plaintiffs are California citizens, there is no complete diversity, and thus, the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Remand to State Court**: The court ordered the case remanded to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c)**.\n\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions related to the case were denied as moot given the remand.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe court concluded that Wells Fargo's citizenship, as a national bank, included both its main office and its principal place of business, resulting in a lack of complete diversity.

They claimed that WFB initiated foreclosure proceedings while these discussions were ongoing.\n\n2. **Allegations of Dual Tracking**: The Garcias alleged that WFB's actions amounted to 'dual tracking,' a practice where a lender pursues foreclosure while simultaneously considering a loan modification application. This practice is prohibited under **Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2924.12**.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Communication**: The Garcias indicated that WFB did not provide a single point of contact as required by **Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2923.7**, causing them to be transferred between different representatives. They also claimed that WFB repeatedly asked for documents they had already submitted.\n\n4. **Notice of Trustee\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing loan modification negotiations.\n\n#### Transfer to Federal Court\n\nWFB moved the case to federal court, asserting diversity jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332**. WFB claimed:\n- The Garcias are residents of California.\n- WFB is a resident of South Dakota.\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a resident of Delaware, Texas, Michigan, and Minnesota.\n\n#### Legal Principles\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332**, federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions where the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 and the parties are residents of different states. The removal statute is strictly interpreted against removal jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Corporate Residency**: A corporation is considered a resident of the state where it is incorporated and the state where its principal place of business is located. For national banks, **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348** provides that they are residents of the states in which they are 'located.'\n\n#### Jurisdictional Analysis\n\n1. **National Banking Association**: WFB, as a national bank, is subject to a different jurisdictional provision. The court noted that WFB is a resident of the state where its main office is located, as established in its articles of incorporation.\n\n2. **Interpretations of 'Located'**: The term 'located' for national banks has been interpreted differently by courts:\n   - Where the bank has its main office.\n   - Where it has branches.\n   - Where its principal place of business is.\n\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**:\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt*, the Supreme Court held that a national bank is a resident of the state where its main office is located. The Court did not resolve whether a bank could also be a resident of the state where its principal place of business is located.\n   - Courts have generally recognized both definitions, leading to varying interpretations across circuits.\n\n#### Court's Ruling\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Not Available**: The court found that WFB is a resident of both California and South Dakota. Since the Garcias are California residents, there is no complete diversity, and thus, the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Return to State Court**: The court ordered the case returned to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c)**.\n\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions related to the case were denied as moot given the return to state court.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe court concluded that Wells Fargo's residency, as a national bank, included both its main office and its principal place of business, resulting in a lack of complete diversity. Consequently, the case was returned to state court, affirming the strong presumption against removal jurisdiction.\n\n### Significant Authorities Cited\n\n- **Cal. Civ.

For national banks, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348 provides that they are citizens of the states in which they are 'located.'\n\n#### Jurisdictional Examination\n\n1. **National Banking Association**: The court examined whether WFB, as a national bank, is a citizen of both South Dakota (where its main office is located) and California (where the Garcias reside).\n\n2. **Interpretations of 'Located'**: The term \u201clocated\u201d has been interpreted in various ways:\n   - Main office location.\n   - Branch locations.\n   - Principal place of business.\n\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**:\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt*, the Supreme Court confirmed that a national bank is a citizen of the state of its main office.\n   - Courts have generally ruled that a national bank may be considered a citizen of both its main office and principal place of business.\n\n#### Court's Ruling\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Not Available**: The court determined that WFB is a citizen of both California and South Dakota, thereby negating complete diversity. As a result, the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Return to State Court**: The court ordered the case remanded to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).\n\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions were denied as moot due to the remand.\n\n### Summary of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights\n\nThe California Homeowner Bill of Rights became law on January 1, 2013, with many provisions renewed and modified as of January 1, 2019. It aims to safeguard homeowners facing foreclosure, particularly with respect to dual tracking and loan modifications.\n\n#### Key Elements\n\n1. **Foreclosure-Prevention Options Notification**: Servicers must contact homeowners at least 30 days before starting foreclosure to discuss options. They must also provide information regarding alternatives to avoid foreclosure after recording a notice of default.\n\n2. **Guaranteed Single Point of Contact**: Homeowners must be assigned a specific representative to guide them through the loan modification process.\n\n3. **Application Acknowledgment**: Servicers must notify homeowners of any missing information or errors in their loan modification applications within five business days.\n\n4. **Fees Restrictions**: Homeowners cannot be charged fees for applying for a loan modification and cannot incur late fees while the servicer is reviewing their application.\n\n5. **Dual Tracking Restrictions**: The foreclosure process must be paused while a loan modification application is under review, and foreclosure cannot proceed while homeowners comply with an approved modification plan.\n\n6. **Denial Rights**: If a loan modification is denied, the servicer must provide written reasons and allow homeowners to appeal the decision.\n\n7. **Transfer Rights**: If a loan modification is approved and the loan is sold or transferred, the new servicer must honor the existing modification.\n\n8. **Document Verification**: Servicers must ensure that foreclosure documents are accurate and supported by reliable evidence.\n\n9. **Tenant Rights**: Purchasers of foreclosed homes must provide tenants with at least 90 days before starting eviction proceedings and must honor existing leases in certain circumstances.\n\n#### Implementation and Enforcement\n\nThe Homeowner Bill of Rights applies to first-lien mortgages on owner-occupied homes with no more than four units. Homeowners who believe their rights have been violated may seek legal assistance and report violations to relevant state authorities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe court's decision in *Garcia v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA* centered on the determination of WFB's citizenship for diversity jurisdiction purposes, ultimately leading to a remand to state court. Simultaneously, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights offers strong protections for homeowners against foreclosure practices, ensuring that lenders adhere to specific protocols during the loan modification process."},

Garcia filed a complaint against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (WFB) and other defendants, alleging violations related to the California Homeowner Bill of Rights, specifically regarding 'dual tracking' of their mortgage. The case was originally filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and was subsequently removed to federal court by WFB based on diversity jurisdiction.\n\n#### Background Facts\n\n1. **Loan Modification Negotiations**: The plaintiffs were engaged in negotiations with WFB to obtain a modification of their home loan for property located at 17129 Leal Ave., Cerritos, California. They claimed that while these negotiations were ongoing, WFB initiated foreclosure proceedings against their property.\n\n2. **Claims of Dual Tracking**: The plaintiffs alleged that WFB's actions constituted 'dual tracking,' which occurs when a lender pursues foreclosure while simultaneously considering a loan modification application. This practice is prohibited under **Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2924.12**.\n\n3. **Lack of Communication**: The plaintiffs indicated that WFB failed to provide a single point of contact as required by **Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2923.7**, resulting in them being shuffled between representatives. They also claimed that WFB repeatedly requested documentation that they had already submitted.\n\n4. **Notice of Trustee\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing negotiations for loan modification.\n\n#### Removal to Federal Court\n\nWFB removed the case to federal court, asserting diversity jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332**. WFB claimed:\n- The plaintiffs are citizens of California.\n- WFB is a citizen of South Dakota.\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a citizen of Delaware, Texas, Michigan, and Minnesota.\n\n#### Legal Standards\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332**, federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the parties are citizens of different states. The removal statute is strictly construed against removal jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Corporate Citizenship**: A corporation is deemed a citizen of the state of incorporation and the state where its principal place of business is located. For national banks, **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348** provides that they are citizens of the states in which they are 'located.'\n\n#### Jurisdictional Analysis\n\n1. **National Banking Association**: WFB, as a national bank, is governed by a different jurisdictional provision. The court noted that WFB is a citizen of the state where its main office is located, as established in its articles of incorporation.\n\n2. **Definitions of 'Located'**: The term 'located' for national banks has been interpreted in various ways by courts:\n   - Where the bank has its main office.\n   - Where it has branches.\n   - Where its principal place of business is.\n\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**:\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt*, the Supreme Court held that a national bank is a citizen of the state where its main office is located. The Court did not resolve whether a bank could also be a citizen of the state where its principal place of business is located.\n   - Courts have generally recognized both definitions, leading to varying interpretations across circuits.\n\n#### Court's Decision\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Unavailable**: The court found that WFB is a citizen of both California and South Dakota. Since the plaintiffs are California citizens, there is no complete diversity, and thus, the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Remand to State Court**: The court ordered the case remanded to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c)**.\n\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions related to the case were denied as moot given the remand.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe court concluded that Wells Fargo's citizenship, as a national bank, included both its main office and its principal place of business, resulting in a lack of complete diversity. Consequently, the case was remanded back to state court, affirming the strong presumption against removal jurisdiction.\n\n### Key Authorities Cited\n\n- **Cal. Civ.

Cal. 2014) and its relevance to credit card borrower rights:\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Central District of California  \n**Date Filed:** January 3, 2014  \n**Citation:** 990 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 2014 WL 29354  \n**Case Number:** Case No. CV 13-9325 FMO (SHx)  \n**Judge:** Fernando M. Olguin\n\n#### Introduction\n\nRafael Garcia and Martha C. Garcia, the plaintiffs, filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (WFB) and other defendants, alleging they violated the California Homeowner Bill of Rights, specifically regarding 'dual tracking' of their mortgage. The case was initially filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court and subsequently moved to federal court by WFB, based on diversity jurisdiction.\n\n#### Background Information\n\n1. **Loan Modification Discussions**: The plaintiffs were in talks with WFB to modify their home loan for their property at 17129 Leal Ave., Cerritos, California. They claimed that WFB initiated foreclosure proceedings while these discussions were ongoing.\n\n2. **Allegations of Dual Tracking**: The plaintiffs alleged that WFB's actions constituted 'dual tracking,' which involves a lender pursuing foreclosure while considering a loan modification application. This practice is prohibited under **Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2924.12**.\n\n3. **Lack of Communication**: The plaintiffs stated that WFB did not provide a single point of contact as required by **Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2923.7**, resulting in them being transferred between representatives. They also claimed that WFB repeatedly requested documents that they had already submitted.\n\n4. **Notice of Trustee\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing negotiations for loan modification.\n\n#### Transfer to Federal Court\n\nWFB transferred the case to federal court, claiming diversity jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332**. WFB stated:\n- The plaintiffs are residents of California.\n- WFB is a resident of South Dakota.\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a resident of Delaware, Texas, Michigan, and Minnesota.\n\n#### Legal Principles\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332**, federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions where the matter in dispute exceeds $75,000 and the parties are residents of different states. The removal statute is strictly interpreted against removal jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Corporate Residency**: A corporation is considered a resident of the state of incorporation and the state where its principal place of business is located. For national banks, **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348** states that they are residents of the states in which they are 'located.'\n\n#### Jurisdictional Review\n\n1. **National Banking Association**: WFB, as a national bank, is subject to a different jurisdictional provision. The court noted that WFB is a resident of the state where its main office is located, as established in its articles of incorporation.\n\n2. **Interpretations of 'Located'**: The term 'located' for national banks has been interpreted in various ways by courts:\n   - Where the bank has its main office.\n   - Where it has branches.\n   - Where its principal place of business is.\n\n3. **Supreme Court and Circuit Court Precedents**:\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt*, the Supreme Court ruled that a national bank is a resident of the state where its main office is located. The Court did not resolve whether a bank could also be a resident of the state where its principal place of business is located.\n   - Courts have generally recognized both definitions, leading to varying interpretations across circuits.\n\n#### Court's Ruling\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Not Available**: The court determined that WFB is a resident of both California and South Dakota. Since the plaintiffs are California residents, there is no complete diversity, and thus, the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Return to State Court**: The court ordered the case returned to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c)**.\n\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions related to the case were denied as moot given the return to state court.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe court concluded that Wells Fargo's residency, as a national bank, included both its main office and its principal place of business, resulting in a lack of complete diversity. Consequently, the case was returned to state court, affirming the strong presumption against removal jurisdiction.\n\n### Key Authorities Referenced\n\n- **Cal. Civ.

Cal. 2014) and its implications for credit card borrowers:\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Central District of California  \n**Filed:** January 3, 2014  \n**Citation:** 990 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 2014 WL 29354  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. CV 13-9325 FMO (SHx)  \n**Judge:** Fernando M. Olguin\n\n#### Introduction\n\nRafael Garcia and Martha C. Garcia, the plaintiffs, brought a lawsuit against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (WFB) and other defendants, alleging violations of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights, specifically concerning 'dual tracking' of their mortgage. The case was initially filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and was subsequently moved to federal court by WFB on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.\n\n#### Factual Background\n\n1. **Loan Modification Discussions**: The plaintiffs were engaged in discussions with WFB to modify their home loan for a property located at 17129 Leal Ave., Cerritos, California. They claimed that WFB initiated foreclosure proceedings against their property while these discussions were ongoing.\n\n2. **Allegations of Dual Tracking**: The plaintiffs alleged that WFB's actions constituted 'dual tracking,' which involves a lender pursuing foreclosure while simultaneously considering a loan modification application. This practice is prohibited under **Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2924.12**.\n\n3. **Lack of Communication**: The plaintiffs indicated that WFB failed to provide a single point of contact as required by **Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2923.7**, resulting in them being transferred between representatives. They also claimed that WFB repeatedly requested documentation that they had already submitted.\n\n4. **Notice of Trustee\u2019s Sale**: WFB recorded a notice of trustee's sale on November 5, 2013, scheduling the sale for December 2, 2013, despite the ongoing negotiations for loan modification.\n\n#### Transfer to Federal Court\n\nWFB moved the case to federal court, asserting diversity jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332**. WFB claimed:\n- The plaintiffs are residents of California.\n- WFB is a resident of South Dakota.\n- NDex West, L.L.C. is a resident of Delaware, Texas, Michigan, and Minnesota.\n\n#### Legal Principles\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332**, federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the parties are residents of different states. The removal statute is strictly interpreted against removal jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Corporate Residency**: A corporation is considered a resident of the state of incorporation and the state where its principal place of business is located. For national banks, **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348** provides that they are residents of the states in which they are 'located.'\n\n#### Jurisdictional Analysis\n\n1. **National Banking Association**: WFB, as a national bank, is subject to a different jurisdictional provision. The court noted that WFB is a resident of the state where its main office is located, as established in its articles of incorporation.\n\n2. **Interpretations of 'Located'**: The term 'located' for national banks has been interpreted in various ways by courts:\n   - Where the bank has its main office.\n   - Where it has branches.\n   - Where its principal place of business is.\n\n3. **Precedents from Supreme Court and Circuit Courts**:\n   - In *Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt*, the Supreme Court held that a national bank is a resident of the state where its main office is located. The Court did not resolve whether a bank could also be a resident of the state where its principal place of business is located.\n   - Courts have generally recognized both definitions, leading to varying interpretations across circuits.\n\n#### Court's Ruling\n\n1. **Diversity Jurisdiction Unavailable**: The court found that WFB is a resident of both California and South Dakota. Since the plaintiffs are California residents, there is no complete diversity, and thus, the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Return to State Court**: The court ordered the case returned to the Superior Court of California for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under **28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c)**.\n\n3. **Denial of Pending Motions**: All pending motions related to the case were denied as moot given the return to state court.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe court concluded that Wells Fargo's residency, as a national bank, included both its main office and its principal place of business, resulting in a lack of complete diversity. Consequently, the case was returned back to state court, affirming the strong presumption against removal jurisdiction.\n\n### Key Authorities Cited\n\n- **Cal. Civ.

# Melanie L. Garcia v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA (11th Cir. 2018): Issue if an individual wanted to get out of a lawsuit via arbitration and the bank 

{"input": "Answer a claim by the bank that a party waived arbitration when they prefer arbitration.", "output": "### Summary of *Melanie L. Garcia v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA*, 889 F.3d 1230 (11th Cir. 2018)\n\n**Court:** United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit  \n**Filed:** May 10, 2018  \n**Citation:** 889 F.3d 1230  \n**Docket Numbers:** 16-16820; 16-16823  \n**Judges:** Tjoflat, Jordan, Steele  \n**Author:** Tjoflat  \n\n#### Nature of the Suit\n\nThis case arises from five class actions filed by customers of Wells Fargo Bank, alleging unlawful overdraft fees. The central issue on appeal was whether Wells Fargo waived its right to compel arbitration for unnamed class members.\n\n#### Case Facts\n\n1. **Background of the Actions**: \n   - Plaintiffs, including Dolores Gutierrez, Marc Martinez, and Melanie L. Garcia, are current or former checking account holders of Wells Fargo or Wachovia Bank.\n   - The allegations focus on improper overdraft fees charged by Wells Fargo. \n\n2. **Consolidation of Cases**: \n   - In June 2009, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated these cases with others against banks accused of similar practices.\n\n3. **Arbitration Agreements**: \n   - Wells Fargo\u2019s customer agreements included clauses for arbitration of disputes on an individual basis, explicitly prohibiting class actions.\n   - The agreements stated that either party could compel arbitration 'at any reasonable time' notwithstanding any ongoing litigation.\n\n4. **Wells Fargo's Actions**:\n   - After the consolidation, Wells Fargo did not move to compel arbitration for the named plaintiffs but instead joined an omnibus motion to dismiss.\n   - In April 2010, after observing that few defendants had moved to compel arbitration, the District Court ordered defendants intending to seek arbitration to do so by April 19, 2010. Wells Fargo responded that it would not seek arbitration against the named plaintiffs but reserved its rights against unnamed future plaintiffs.\n\n5. **Concepcion Decision**: \n   - Following the Supreme Court's decision in *AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion* (2011), which upheld the enforceability of arbitration agreements barring class actions, Wells Fargo reconsidered its strategy and moved to compel arbitration against the named plaintiffs. The District Court denied this motion, finding Wells Fargo waived its arbitration rights.\n\n6. **Subsequent Proceedings**:\n   - The named plaintiffs sought class certification, while Wells Fargo filed conditional motions to compel arbitration against unnamed class members if the class was certified. The District Court denied these motions, leading to the appeal.\n\n#### Court's Analysis\n\n1. **Standard of Review**: \n   - The Court reviewed the denial of the motion to compel arbitration de novo and recognized that arbitration rights can be waived, but federal law strongly favors arbitration.\n\n2. **Waiver of Arbitration Rights**: \n   - The Court conducted a two-part inquiry to assess waiver: (1) whether Wells Fargo acted inconsistently with its arbitration rights and (2) whether such conduct prejudiced the plaintiffs.\n   - The Court noted that Wells Fargo had not acted inconsistently regarding unnamed plaintiffs as it had reserved its arbitration rights explicitly.\n\n3. **Judicial Precedents Cited**:\n   - **Benoay v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc.**, 805 F.2d 1437 (11th Cir. 1986): Established that the right to arbitrate can be waived.\n   - **Stone v. E.F. Hutton & Co.**, 898 F.2d 1542 (11th Cir. 1990): Emphasized the heavy burden of proof on the party claiming waiver.\n   - **Ivax Corp. v. B. Braun of Am., Inc.**, 286 F.3d 1309 (11th Cir. 2002): Discussed the inconsistency standard for waiver.\n   - **S & H Contractors v. A.J. Taft Coal Co., Inc.**, 906 F.2d 1507 (11th Cir. 1990): Outlined considerations of prejudice regarding arbitration rights.\n\n4. **Final Determinations**: \n   - The Court found that Wells Fargo had not acted inconsistently with its arbitration rights concerning unnamed class members. The District Court's reliance on Wells Fargo's failure to move to compel arbitration before the class was certified was deemed inappropriate due to the speculative nature of the unnamed plaintiffs at that stage.\n   - The Court concluded that the District Court\u2019s order was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit vacated the District Court's order denying Wells Fargo's motion to compel arbitration concerning unnamed class members, determining that Wells Fargo did not waive its arbitration rights. The ruling emphasizes the need for clarity regarding arbitration rights in class action contexts and the importance of timely invoking those rights without inconsistent actions.\n\n### Key Authorities Cited\n\n- **AT&T Mobility LLC v.

Wells Fargo stated it would not seek arbitration against the named plaintiffs but reserved its rights against unnamed future plaintiffs.\n\n5. **Concepcion Ruling**:\n   - After the Supreme Court's decision in *AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion* (2011), which upheld the validity of arbitration agreements barring class actions, Wells Fargo reconsidered its strategy and moved to compel arbitration against the named plaintiffs. The District Court denied this motion, finding Wells Fargo had forfeited its arbitration rights.\n\n6. **Later Developments**:\n   - The named plaintiffs sought class certification, while Wells Fargo filed conditional motions to compel arbitration against unnamed class members if the class was certified. The District Court denied these motions, leading to the appeal.\n\n#### Court's Examination\n\n1. **Review Standard**:\n   - The Court reviewed the denial of the motion to compel arbitration de novo and acknowledged that arbitration rights can be forfeited, but federal law strongly favors arbitration.\n\n2. **Forfeiture of Arbitration Rights**:\n   - The Court conducted a two-part inquiry to evaluate forfeiture: (1) whether Wells Fargo acted inconsistently with its arbitration rights and (2) whether such conduct harmed the plaintiffs.\n   - The Court noted that Wells Fargo had not acted inconsistently regarding unnamed plaintiffs as it had explicitly reserved its arbitration rights.\n\n3. **Cited Precedents**:\n   - **Benoay v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc.**, 805 F.2d 1437 (11th Cir. 1986): Established that the right to arbitrate can be forfeited.\n   - **Stone v. E.F. Hutton & Co.**, 898 F.2d 1542 (11th Cir. 1990): Emphasized the heavy burden of proof on the party claiming forfeiture.\n   - **Ivax Corp. v. B. Braun of Am., Inc.**, 286 F.3d 1309 (11th Cir. 2002): Discussed the inconsistency standard for forfeiture.\n   - **S & H Contractors v. A.J. Taft Coal Co., Inc.**, 906 F.2d 1507 (11th Cir. 1990): Outlined considerations of prejudice regarding arbitration rights.\n\n4. **Final Rulings**:\n   - The Court determined that Wells Fargo had not acted inconsistently with its arbitration rights concerning unnamed class members. The District Court's reliance on Wells Fargo's failure to move to compel arbitration before the class was certified was deemed inappropriate due to the speculative nature of the unnamed plaintiffs at that stage.\n   - The Court concluded that the District Court\u2019s order was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit vacated the District Court's order denying Wells Fargo's motion to compel arbitration concerning unnamed class members, determining that Wells Fargo did not forfeit its arbitration rights. The decision underscores the importance of clarity regarding arbitration rights in class action contexts and the necessity of timely invoking those rights without inconsistent actions.\n\n### Significant Authorities Cited\n\n- **AT&T Mobility LLC v.

Seymour  \n\n#### Case Overview\n\n**Parties:**\n- **Plaintiff:** Midland Mortgage Corporation (a South Carolina corporation)\n- **Defendant:** Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (a national banking association)\n\n**Nature of the Suit:** \nThe Plaintiff filed for damages alleging state law claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation against the Defendant.\n\n### Issues at Hand\n\n1. **Duty of Care**: Did Wells Fargo owe a duty of care to Midland Mortgage regarding the Verification of Deposit (VOD)?\n2. **Breach of Duty**: Did Wells Fargo breach this duty by providing an inaccurate VOD?\n3. **Proximate Cause**: Was Wells Fargo's breach the proximate cause of Midland Mortgage's injuries?\n4. **Justifiable Reliance**: Did Midland Mortgage reasonably rely on the VOD provided by Wells Fargo?\n5. **Economic Loss Rule**: Does the economic loss rule bar Midland Mortgage's claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation?\n\n### Relevant Case Facts\n\n1. **Loan Agreement**: Midland Mortgage contracted to make a loan to Brian and Teri Sumsion for property purchase, requiring a VOD from Wells Fargo to verify sufficient funds for closing costs.\n2. **VOD Issuance**: Midland paid $20 for the VOD, which indicated a balance of $1,578.51 in the Sumsions' account as of February 14, 2008. The loan closed on February 25, 2008.\n3. **Insurance Coverage Rescinded**: JP Morgan Chase informed Midland that the mortgage insurer, Republic Mortgage Insurance Company (RMIC), had rescinded coverage due to misrepresented financial information.\n4. **Reverification of VOD**: A re-VOD was requested, and Wells Fargo confirmed the original VOD was correct, despite subsequent findings indicating the actual balance was $0.\n5. **Repurchase Demand**: Midland had to repurchase the loan from Chase due to the rescinded insurance and inaccurate VOD, costing approximately $99,256.00.\n\n### Court Proceedings\n\n- **Defendant's Motions**: Wells Fargo filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.\n- **Plaintiff's Opposition**: Midland opposed both motions with supporting arguments and evidence.\n\n### Legal Standards Cited\n\n1. **Summary Judgment Standard**: Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, a motion for summary judgment is granted if no genuine dispute of material fact exists.\n   - **Key Cases**: \n     - *Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.*, 477 U.S. 242 (1986)\n     - *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*, 477 U.S. 317 (1986)\n     - *Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc.*, 53 F.3d 55 (4th Cir. 1995)\n\n2. **Dismissal Standard**: For a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the court must accept well-pleaded allegations as true and determine if the complaint states a plausible claim.\n   - **Key Cases**: \n     - *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)\n     - *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)\n\n3. **Negligence Standards**: To prove negligence in South Carolina, a plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, and damages.\n   - **Key Cases**: \n     - *Dorrell v. S.C. Dep't of Transp.*, 361 S.C. 312 (2004)\n     - *Snow v. City of Columbia*, 305 S.C. 544 (1991)\n\n4. **Negligent Misrepresentation**: A claimant must show a false representation, a pecuniary interest, a duty of care, breach, justifiable reliance, and resulting damages.\n   - **Key Cases**: \n     - *AMA Mgmt. Corp. v. Strasburger*, 309 S.C. 213 (1992)\n     - *Winburn v. Ins.

Trane Carolina Plains*, 350 F.Supp.2d 699 (D.S.C. 2004)\n\n### Court's Findings\n\n1. **No Duty of Care**: The court ruled that Wells Fargo did not owe a duty of care to Midland Mortgage concerning the VOD, as the relationship did not indicate a special duty due to the arm's length nature of the transaction.\n  \n2. **Breach of Duty**: Even if a duty existed, there was insufficient evidence of a breach, as Midland's claims relied on unsupported statements rather than factual evidence.\n\n3. **Proximate Causation**: The court found that the inaccurate VOD was not the proximate cause of Midland's injuries, which stemmed from the Borrowers\u2019 failure to repay the loan, not from the VOD itself.\n\n4. **Justifiable Reliance**: The court concluded that Midland could not justifiably rely on the VOD due to disclaimers contained within the document and the absence of a fiduciary relationship.\n\n5. **Economic Loss Rule**: The court did not need to address this issue since it had already ruled in favor of Wells Fargo on the negligence claims.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe court granted Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment concerning Midland Mortgage's claims of negligence and negligent misrepresentation, finding no duty of care existed and that Midland failed to establish breach, causation, or justifiable reliance. The motion to dismiss was denied as moot.\n\n### Key Authorities Cited\n\n- **Federal Rules of Civil Procedure**: Rule 12(b)(6), Rule 56\n- **Case Law**:\n  - *Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.*, 477 U.S. 242 (1986)\n  - *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*, 477 U.S. 317 (1986)\n  - *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)\n  - *Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

The loan closed on February 25, 2008.\n3. **Insurance Coverage Rescinded:** JP Morgan Chase informed Midland that the mortgage insurer, Republic Mortgage Insurance Company (RMIC), had rescinded coverage due to misrepresented financial information.\n4. **VOD Reverification:** A re-VOD was requested, and Wells Fargo confirmed the original VOD was correct, despite subsequent findings indicating the actual balance was $0.\n5. **Repurchase Demand:** Midland had to repurchase the loan from Chase due to the rescinded insurance and inaccurate VOD, costing approximately $99,256.00.\n\n### Court Proceedings\n\n- **Defendant's Motions:** Wells Fargo filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.\n- **Plaintiff's Response:** Midland opposed both motions with supporting arguments and evidence.\n\n### Legal Principles Applied\n\n1. **Summary Judgment Standard:** Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, a motion for summary judgment is granted if no genuine dispute of material fact exists.\n   - **Key Cases:**\n     - *Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.*, 477 U.S. 242 (1986)\n     - *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*, 477 U.S. 317 (1986)\n     - *Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc.*, 53 F.3d 55 (4th Cir. 1995)\n\n2. **Dismissal Standard:** For a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the court must accept well-pleaded allegations as true and determine if the complaint states a plausible claim.\n   - **Key Cases:**\n     - *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)\n     - *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)\n\n3. **Negligence Standards:** To prove negligence in South Carolina, a plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, and damages.\n   - **Key Cases:**\n     - *Dorrell v. S.C. Dep't of Transp.*, 361 S.C. 312 (2004)\n     - *Snow v. City of Columbia*, 305 S.C. 544 (1991)\n\n4. **Negligent Misrepresentation:** A claimant must show a false representation, a pecuniary interest, a duty of care, breach, justifiable reliance, and resulting damages.\n   - **Key Cases:**\n     - *AMA Mgmt. Corp. v. Strasburger*, 309 S.C. 213 (1992)\n     - *Winburn v. Ins.

Trane Carolina Plains*, 350 F.Supp.2d 699 (D.S.C. 2004)\n\n### Court's Rulings\n\n1. **No Duty of Care:** The court determined that Wells Fargo did not owe a duty of care to Midland Mortgage concerning the VOD, as the relationship did not indicate a special duty due to the arm's length nature of the transaction.\n\n2. **Breach of Duty:** Even if a duty existed, there was insufficient evidence of a breach, as Midland's claims relied on unsupported statements rather than factual evidence.\n\n3. **Causation:** The court found that the inaccurate VOD was not the direct cause of Midland's damages, which stemmed from the Borrowers\u2019 failure to repay the loan, not from the VOD itself.\n\n4. **Reasonable Reliance:** The court concluded that Midland could not reasonably rely on the VOD due to disclaimers contained within the document and the absence of a fiduciary relationship.\n\n5. **Economic Loss Rule:** The court did not need to address this issue since it had already ruled in favor of Wells Fargo on the negligence claims.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe court granted Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment concerning Midland Mortgage's claims of negligence and negligent misrepresentation, finding no duty of care existed and that Midland failed to establish breach, causation, or reasonable reliance. The motion to dismiss was denied as moot.\n\n### Significant Authorities Cited\n\n- **Federal Rules of Civil Procedure**: Rule 12(b)(6), Rule 56\n- **Case Law**:\n  - *Anderson v.

Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)\n     - *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)\n\n3. **Negligence Standards:** To prove negligence in South Carolina, a plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, and damages.\n   - **Key Cases:**\n     - *Dorrell v.

America Online Inc., 208 F.3d 741 (9th Cir. 2000) does not preclude private actions under RICO. In fact, the case itself involved private plaintiffs bringing RICO claims, which were dismissed on other grounds. To negate a defendant's claim that private RICO actions are not authorized based on Howard, you can cite the following case law:\n\n1. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479 (1985)\n\nThis Supreme Court case explicitly recognized the private right of action under RICO. The Court stated:\n\n'Given the plain words of the statute, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that Congress intended to limit RICO actions to those against defendants who had been convicted on criminal charges.'[1]\n\n2. RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Cmty., 136 S. Ct. 2090 (2016)\n\nThis more recent Supreme Court case reaffirmed the availability of private RICO actions, noting:\n\n'RICO creates a private right of action for '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation' of the statute's substantive restrictions.'[2]\n\n3. Painters and Allied Trades District Council 82 Health Care Fund v. Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., 943 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 2019)\n\nThis Ninth Circuit case, decided after Howard, clearly demonstrates that private RICO actions are still permitted within the circuit. The court reversed the dismissal of civil RICO claims, stating:\n\n'We conclude that the alleged misrepresentations plausibly caused physicians to prescribe, and third party payors to pay for, Actos instead of other drugs.'[9]\n\n4.

The statute expressly states that '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court.''[7]\n\nThese cases clearly illustrate that private RICO actions are authorized and continue to be recognized by courts at all levels, including the Supreme Court and within the Ninth Circuit. Howard v. America Online Inc. does not contradict this established principle.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1506&context=uclf\n[2] https://www.jenner.com/a/web/taV21sfHsERD37g5Wk8dA6/4HRMZQ/2021_RICO_Guide.pdf\n[3] https://www.jonesday.com/-/media/files/publications/2023/09/rico-trade-secret-standard-prevails-within-9th-circ-courts-law360/files/law360--rico-trade-secret-standard-prevails-withi/fileattachment/law360--rico-trade-secret-standard-prevails-with.pdf?rev=1c5c08d7799c40ee96976d6fb3bf442c\n[4] https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914ba82add7b04934791458\n[5] https://casetext.com/case/howard-v-america-online\n[6] https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-caed-2_21-cv-00477/pdf/USCOURTS-caed-2_21-cv-00477-4.pdf\n[7] https://casetext.com/case/basic-energy-servs\n[8] https://www.lawcatalog.com/media/productattach/r/i/rico_chapter_1-r47.pdf\n[9] https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/18-55588/18-55588-2019-12-03.html\n[10] https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/96-950/12\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961-63, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), Pub.L.

Ariz. 2019) Case Summary:**\n\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. ('Wells Fargo') filed a motion for summary judgment against Ferruggio Insurance Services of L.A., Inc. ('Ferruggio') on Count One of its complaint. Ferruggio had deposited a check drawn on Pacific Western Bank into its account with Wells Fargo, which was subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank. Wells Fargo sought to recover the amount of the check, $100,000, from Ferruggio. Ferruggio argued that it was not liable for the check because it had agreed with Carrillo, the payee, not to deposit the check and to use another payment method instead.\n\n**Key Holdings:**\n\n1.  **Wells Fargo is a holder of the check**: The court found that Wells Fargo became a holder of the check when it received the check for deposit, and that it was entitled to enforce the check. This decision was based on Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) Section 3-301, which defines a holder as a person who is in possession of an instrument that is payable to bearer or endorsed in a manner that transfers the right to enforce the instrument.\n2.  **Ferruggio's defense fails**: The court found that Ferruggio's defense, that it was not liable for the check because it had agreed with Carrillo not to deposit the check, was not valid because Carrillo was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 3-302, which provides that a person who is not a holder in due course takes the instrument subject to any defenses or claims to which it is subject.\n3.  **Wells Fargo is a holder in due course**: The court found that Wells Fargo was a holder in due course because it had taken the check in good faith and without notice of any defenses or claims. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 3-302, which defines a holder in due course as a holder who has taken an instrument without notice of any defenses or claims.\n4.  **Wells Fargo's security interest is limited**: The court found that Wells Fargo's security interest in the check was limited to the amount of the provisional credit it had provided to the account, which was $75,278.39. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 4-205, which provides that a bank's security interest in an item is limited to the amount of the provisional credit it has provided to the customer's account.\n\n**Relevant Statutes and Rules:**\n\n*   Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.)

('Wells Fargo') filed a motion for summary judgment against Ferruggio Insurance Services of L.A., Inc. ('Ferruggio') on Count One of its complaint. Ferruggio had deposited a check drawn on Pacific Western Bank into its account with Wells Fargo, which was subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank. Wells Fargo sought to recover the amount of the check, $100,000, from Ferruggio. Ferruggio argued that it was not liable for the check because it had agreed with Carrillo, the payee, not to deposit the check and to use another payment method instead.\n\n**Key Holdings:**\n\n1.  **Wells Fargo is a holder of the check**: The court found that Wells Fargo became a holder of the check when it received the check for deposit, and that it was entitled to enforce the check.

Section 3-301, which defines a holder as a person who is in possession of an instrument that is payable to bearer or endorsed in a manner that transfers the right to enforce the instrument.\n2.  **Ferruggio's defense fails**: The court found that Ferruggio's defense, that it was not liable for the check because it had agreed with Carrillo not to deposit the check, was not valid because Carrillo was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument. This decision was based on U.C.C. Section 3-302, which provides that a person who is not a holder in due course takes the instrument subject to any defenses or claims to which it is subject.\n3.  **Wells Fargo is a holder in due course**: The court found that Wells Fargo was a holder in due course because it had taken the check in good faith and without notice of any defenses or claims.

Section 3-302, which defines a holder in due course as a holder who has taken an instrument without notice of any defenses or claims.\n4.  **Wells Fargo's security interest is limited**: The court found that Wells Fargo's security interest in the check was limited to the amount of the provisional credit it had provided to the account, which was $75,278.39.

Section 4-205, which provides that a bank's security interest in an item is limited to the amount of the provisional credit it has provided to the customer's account.\n\n**Relevant Statutes and Rules:**\n\n*   Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.)

However, if the customer has a valid defense to the check, such as a dispute over the authenticity of the check, they may not be responsible.\n*   **Bank's responsibility for a dishonored check**: If a bank takes a check in good faith and without notice of any defenses or claims, it may be responsible for the check. However, if the bank has a valid defense to the check, such as a dispute over the authenticity of the check, it may not be responsible.\n*   **Security interest in a check**: A bank's security interest in a check is limited to the amount of the provisional credit it has provided to the customer's account. This means that if the customer has deposited a check into their account and the check is later dishonored, the bank's security interest in the check is limited to the amount of the provisional credit it has provided.\n*   **Holder in due course**: A holder in due course is a person who has taken an instrument without notice of any defenses or claims. This means that if a person takes a check in good faith and without notice of any defenses or claims, they may be a holder in due course and entitled to enforce the check."},

Supp. 2d 549 (S.D.W. Va 2005), heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, the plaintiff raised several issues against Wells Fargo and Countrywide. These included alleged violations of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and unconscionable contract claims under the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act (Counts I and II). Additionally, the plaintiff accused Countrywide of breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, unauthorized charges, and failure to provide statements of account (Counts III, IV, and V). Joint venture, conspiracy, and agency claims were also made against all defendants (Count VIII).\n\nThe court referenced several key pieces of case law in reaching its decision. These included the TILA (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq.) and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639 and \u00a7 1602(aa)). The court also considered precedents set in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett and Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., which provided guidance on summary judgment standards and materiality and genuineness of fact issues, respectively. Other relevant cases included Dash v. Firstplus Home Loan Trust, In re Rodrigues, Cooper v. First Government Mortgage & Inv. Corp., and Mourer v. Equicredit Corp. of America.\n\nAuthorities cited in the case included the West Virginia Code (W.Va.Code \u00a7 46-3-308(b)) and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (\u00a7 366 (1981)). The Federal Reserve Board's Official Staff Interpretation of TILA and HOEPA was also referenced.\n\nIn its decision, the court denied Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment on Counts I, II, and VIII, finding genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the plaintiff's loan qualified as a high-cost loan under HOEPA. This impacted Wells Fargo's holder-in-due-course defense. Countrywide's motion for summary judgment was granted on Counts I and II, but denied on Count VIII.

These included alleged violations of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and unconscionable contract claims under the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act (Counts I and II). Additionally, the plaintiff accused Countrywide of breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, unauthorized charges, and failure to provide statements of account (Counts III, IV, and V). Joint venture, conspiracy, and agency claims were also made against all defendants (Count VIII).\n\nThe court referenced several key pieces of case law in reaching its decision. These included the TILA (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq.) and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639 and \u00a7 1602(aa)).

This impacted Wells Fargo's holder-in-due-course defense. Countrywide's motion for summary judgment was granted on Counts I and II, but denied on Count VIII.

The definition of 'adverse action' includes actions such as the revocation of credit, which was supported by the fact that Wells Fargo claimed the entire balance was due and payable due to default.\n  \n- The court emphasized that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA\u2019s notice requirement mandates that creditors provide a statement of reasons for adverse actions taken. Since Wells Fargo did not send the required notice after the alleged acceleration of the loan, the Schlegels had sufficiently stated a claim under ECOA.\n\n- The court distinguished between mere clerical errors and the egregious conduct alleged by the Schlegels, noting that Wells Fargo's actions went beyond mistakes, as it continued to misrepresent the status of the loan despite the Schlegels' inquiries.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe Ninth Circuit reversed the dismissal of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA claim, allowing the plaintiffs to proceed with their case based on Wells Fargo's failure to provide proper notification of adverse action as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA requires.

{"input": "I am being charged interest charges on interest while I am in bankruptcy making my debt harder to pay off. How can I fight this off.", "output": "The case **Case v. Wells Fargo Bank NA**, 359 B.R. 709 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. 2006), revolves around several Chapter 13 debtors who allege that their mortgage creditors collected 'interest on interest' in violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(e). This statute, enacted by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, limits the interest that can be charged when a debtor cures a default through a Chapter 13 plan.\n\n### Key Points of the Case:\n\n1. **Background**:\n   - The plaintiffs are Chapter 13 debtor-mortgagors who argue that their mortgage lenders received unauthorized payments of interest on already accrued interest, essentially leading to 'interest on interest.'\n\n2. **Legal Context**:\n   - The case references the precedent set by **Rake v. Wade**, where the Supreme Court allowed for 'interest on interest.' However, \u00a7 1322(e) was introduced to counter this ruling, stating that only interest specified in the mortgage agreement should be paid during a plan.\n\n3. **Claims**:\n   - The plaintiffs sought:\n     - Disgorgement of these payments pursuant to \u00a7 502(j) and \u00a7 1322(e).\n     - Abuse of process under \u00a7 105(a).\n     - Actual damages, attorney's fees, and class action certification.\n\n4. **Defendants' Motions to Dismiss**:\n   - The defendants raised multiple defenses, including standing issues, procedural defects, and the argument that there is no private right of action under the claims asserted.\n\n5. **Standing**:\n   - The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs, as Chapter 13 debtors, had standing to bring the claims on behalf of the bankruptcy estate, citing **Cable v. Ivy Tech State College** as precedent.\n\n6. **Procedural Deficiencies**:\n   - The court found the adversary proceedings procedurally defective. The defendants contended that the plaintiffs should have filed a motion to reconsider under **Bankruptcy Rule 3008** rather than initiating adversary proceedings.\n   - The plaintiffs argued that the adversary proceeding was appropriate due to their requests for injunctive relief, which requires such a format.\n\n7. **Court's Conclusion**:\n   - The court ruled that the plaintiffs failed to follow the proper procedure to challenge the alleged violation of \u00a7 1322(e). Therefore, they must proceed with a motion for reconsideration under Rule 3008 before seeking further relief.\n   - All motions to dismiss were granted, and the court did not address other arguments raised by the defendants, deeming them unnecessary to resolve the case.\n\n### Significance:\nThis case highlights the complexities of bankruptcy law, particularly regarding the rights of debtors in Chapter 13 proceedings. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of following the correct procedural channels in bankruptcy cases, specifically when disputing claims against the estate. The ruling also underscores the limitations placed on debtors regarding the recovery of alleged overpayments to creditors."},

Wells Fargo Bank NA**, 359 B.R. 709 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. 2006), revolves around several Chapter 13 debtors who allege that their mortgage creditors collected 'interest on interest' in violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(e). This statute, enacted by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, limits the interest that can be charged when a debtor cures a default through a Chapter 13 plan.\n\n### Key Points of the Case:\n\n1. **Background**:\n   - The plaintiffs are Chapter 13 debtor-mortgagors who argue that their mortgage lenders received unauthorized payments of interest on already accrued interest, essentially leading to 'interest on interest.'\n\n2. **Legal Context**:\n   - The case references the precedent set by **Rake v. Wade**, where the Supreme Court allowed for 'interest on interest.' However, \u00a7 1322(e) was introduced to counter this ruling, stating that only interest specified in the mortgage agreement should be paid during a plan.\n\n3. **Claims**:\n   - The plaintiffs sought:\n     - Disgorgement of these payments pursuant to \u00a7 502(j) and \u00a7 1322(e).\n     - Abuse of process under \u00a7 105(a).\n     - Actual damages, attorney's fees, and class action certification.\n\n4. **Defendants' Motions to Dismiss**:\n   - The defendants raised multiple defenses, including standing issues, procedural defects, and the argument that there is no private right of action under the claims asserted.\n\n5. **Standing**:\n   - The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs, as Chapter 13 debtors, had standing to bring the claims on behalf of the bankruptcy estate, citing **Cable v. Ivy Tech State College** as precedent.\n\n6. **Procedural Deficiencies**:\n   - The court found the adversary proceedings procedurally defective. The defendants contended that the plaintiffs should have filed a motion to reconsider under **Bankruptcy Rule 3008** rather than initiating adversary proceedings.\n   - The plaintiffs argued that the adversary proceeding was appropriate due to their requests for injunctive relief, which requires such a format.\n\n7. **Court's Conclusion**:\n   - The court ruled that the plaintiffs failed to follow the proper procedure to challenge the alleged violation of \u00a7 1322(e). Therefore, they must proceed with a motion for reconsideration under Rule 3008 before seeking further relief.\n   - All motions to dismiss were granted, and the court did not address other arguments raised by the defendants, deeming them unnecessary to resolve the case.\n\n### Significance:\nThis case highlights the complexities of bankruptcy law, particularly regarding the rights of debtors in Chapter 13 proceedings. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of following the correct procedural channels in bankruptcy cases, specifically when disputing claims against the estate. The ruling also underscores the limitations placed on debtors regarding the recovery of alleged overpayments to creditors."},

Mahogany Meadows Avenue Trust, 18-17320 (9th Cir. 2020)\n\n#### Case Name\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Mahogany Meadows Avenue Trust\n\n#### Issues at Hand\n1. Whether the foreclosure sale conducted by a homeowners association (HOA) violated the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n2.

Whether the foreclosure sale was invalid under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.\n\n#### Case Law Cited\n- **Saticoy Bay LLC Series 350 Durango 104 v.

The court affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wells Fargo's complaint for failure to state a claim.\n2. The court held:\n   - No violation of the Takings Clause occurred because the HOA's foreclosure did not constitute state action. The enactment of \u00a7 116.3116 predated Wells Fargo\u2019s lien, meaning Wells Fargo did not have the right to maintain its lien unimpaired by the HOA's lien.\n   - Wells Fargo received constitutionally adequate notice of the foreclosure sale, as the notice complied with statutory requirements.\n   - The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wells Fargo\u2019s motion for reconsideration regarding the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.\n\n#### Reasoning for Decisions\n- **Takings Clause**: The court reasoned that the HOA's foreclosure was private action, not state action. The statute granting superpriority to HOA liens was enacted prior to Wells Fargo's lien, thus Wells Fargo could not claim an uncompensated taking.\n- **Due Process**: The court found that Wells Fargo had received adequate notice according to the prescribed statutory requirements. The argument that the notice was insufficient was characterized as an attack on the statute's validity rather than an as-applied challenge.\n- **Reconsideration Motion**: The court concluded that Wells Fargo had not presented new evidence or arguments that could not have been raised earlier.\n\n#### Prevailing Parties\n- The court ruled in favor of the Defendant-Appellee (Mahogany Meadows Avenue Trust and others) on all counts, affirming the district court\u2019s decision.

The court upheld the lower court's dismissal of Wells Fargo's case due to lack of claim.\n2. The court determined:\n   - The HOA's foreclosure did not violate the Takings Clause, as it was not state action. Nevada's \u00a7 116.3116 was enacted before Wells Fargo's lien, meaning Wells Fargo's lien was not immune to the HOA's lien.\n   - Wells Fargo was given legally sufficient notice of the foreclosure sale, as the notice adhered to the statutory stipulations.\n   - The lower court did not err in refusing Wells Fargo's request for a reconsideration in relation to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.\n\n#### Basis for Rulings\n- **Takings Clause**: The court argued that the HOA's foreclosure was a private action, not a state action. Nevada's statute granting priority to HOA liens was enacted before Wells Fargo's lien, thus Wells Fargo could not claim an uncompensated taking.\n- **Due Process**: The court concluded that Wells Fargo was given adequate notice according to the statutory guidelines. The argument that the notice was insufficient was deemed as an attack on the statute's validity rather than an as-applied challenge.\n- **Reconsideration Request**: The court decided that Wells Fargo did not present any new evidence or arguments that could not have been presented earlier.\n\n#### Successful Parties\n- The court ruled in favor of the Defendant-Appellee (Mahogany Meadows Avenue Trust and others) on all matters, upholding the lower court\u2019s decision."},

Wells Fargo Bank, NA**\n\n#### Key Matters:\n1. **Legitimacy of AIG Insurance Policy**: Was the AIG policy a STOLI policy without an insurable interest?\n2. **Defendants' UCC Defense Claims**: Are Berkshire and Wells Fargo able to assert UCC defenses against the Estate's claim?\n3. **Berkshire's Counterclaims**: Should Berkshire's counterclaims for unjust enrichment and misrepresentation be dismissed?\n\n#### Relevant Case Law:\n- **Price Dawe**: PHL Variable Ins. Co. v. Price Dawe 2006 Ins. Tr., ex rel. Christiana Bank & Tr. Co., 28 A.3d 1059 (Del. 2011)\n- **Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n** (multiple citations)\n- **Della Corp. v. Diamond**, 210 A.2d 847 (Del. 1965)\n- **Zirn v. VLI Corp.**, 681 A.2d 1050 (Del. 1996)\n\n#### Applicable Laws:\n- **Delaware Code Annotated Title 18, \u00a7 2704**: Regulates insurable interest for life insurance policies.\n- **Delaware Code Annotated Title 6, \u00a7 8-502, \u00a7 8-115**: Relates to UCC defenses.\n\n#### Rulings:\n1. **AIG Policy Invalid**: The Court upheld the District Court's decision that the AIG Policy was void under \u00a7 2704(a) due to the absence of insurable interest at inception.\n   - **Rationale**: The Court highlighted that the intent of the insured (Ms. Malkin) is irrelevant; instead, it is the party who procured the policy and whether they had an insurable interest. The circumstances suggested that the policy was part of a STOLI scheme, which is illegal.\n\n2. **UCC Defense Dismissal Reversal**: The Court overturned the District Court's dismissal of Berkshire's counterclaims for misrepresentation.\n   - **Rationale**: The dismissal was based on an incorrect evaluation of evidence outside the pleadings. The Court indicated that Berkshire's claims required further review regarding reliance on Ms. Malkin\u2019s representations.\n\n3. **Certification to Delaware Supreme Court**: The Court certified two questions regarding the applicability of UCC defenses in light of a void policy under \u00a7 2704 and the possibility of recovering premiums paid on such policies.\n\n#### Results:\n- The Estate was successful in proving that the AIG Policy was void.\n- Berkshire's counterclaims for misrepresentation were reinstated for further consideration, but the issue of unjust enrichment and UCC defenses remains unresolved pending certification to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nThis case emphasizes the intricacies of STOLI policies and the interplay between state insurance and commercial laws."}
