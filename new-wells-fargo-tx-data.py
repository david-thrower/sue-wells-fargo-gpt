Dabrowski  \n**Docket Number:** 19-50285  \n**Precedential Status:** Precedential  \n\n**Overview:**  \nHenry J. Woolford and Laurie-Jean A. Woolford (the 'Debtors') filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and sought to reopen their case to determine the dischargeability of a $62,000 loan from Wells Fargo Bank, which they claimed was an unsecured consolidation loan rather than a non-dischargeable student loan under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8).\n\n**Key Procedural History:**  \n- The Debtors initially filed for bankruptcy on August 16, 2001, and received a discharge on December 11, 2001.\n- On August 21, 2003, they moved to reopen their case to contest the dischargeability of the loan, as Wells Fargo had initiated collection actions.\n- Wells Fargo subsequently filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which the Debtors failed to timely oppose.\n\n**Court's Findings:**  \n1. **Deemed Admitted Facts:** Due to the Debtors' lack of timely response, all of Wells Fargo's asserted facts were deemed admitted.\n2. **Key Issues:** The court evaluated whether the loan met the criteria for non-dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(8), which requires that:\n   - The loan was for educational purposes.\n   - It was made, insured, or guaranteed by a government unit or a nonprofit institution.\n\n3. **Educational Nature of the Loan:** The evidence indicated that the loan was used for educational expenses, satisfying the first criterion.\n4. **Government or Nonprofit Funding:** The court found insufficient evidence to establish that the loan met the second criterion.

The Debtors asserted that the loan was funded by a nonprofit organization, but this was not substantiated by the records.\n\n**Outcome:**\nThe court rejected Wells Fargo's Motion for Summary Judgment due to the failure to demonstrate that the loan was issued under the aegis of a government unit or nonprofit institution, despite its educational nature.\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Case Law:\n\n1. **Anderson v.

The Debtors asserted that the loan was financed by a nonprofit organization, but this claim lacked substantiation in the record.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe court rejected Wells Fargo's Motion for Summary Judgment due to the failure to establish that the loan was issued under the auspices of a government entity or nonprofit institution, despite the educational purpose of the loan.\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Case Law:\n\n1. **Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986)**: Established that the judge's role in summary judgment is to determine if there is a genuine issue for trial, rather than to weigh evidence.\n\n2. **Adickes v.

Dabrowski  \n**Docket Number:** 19-50285  \n**Precedential Status:** Precedential\n\n**Case Background:**\nHenry J. Woolford and Laurie-Jean A. Woolford (collectively referred to as the 'Debtors') filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and later sought to reopen their case to decide the dischargeability of a $62,000 loan from Wells Fargo Bank. The Debtors argued that the loan was an unsecured consolidation loan, not a non-dischargeable student loan as per 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8).\n\n**Key Procedural History:**\n- The Debtors initially filed for bankruptcy on August 16, 2001, and obtained a discharge on December 11, 2001.\n- On August 21, 2003, they moved to reopen their case to challenge the dischargeability of the loan, as Wells Fargo had initiated collection actions.\n- Wells Fargo then filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which the Debtors failed to oppose in a timely manner.\n\n**Court's Ruling:**\n1. **Admitted Facts:** Due to the Debtors' untimely response, all facts asserted by Wells Fargo were deemed admitted.\n2. **Key Issues:** The court assessed whether the loan met the criteria for non-dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(8), which requires that:\n   - The loan was for educational expenses.\n   - It was made, insured, or guaranteed by a government unit or a nonprofit institution.\n\n3. **Loan's Educational Purpose:** The evidence suggested that the loan was utilized for educational expenses, fulfilling the first criterion.\n4. **Government or Nonprofit Involvement:** The court found insufficient evidence to prove that the loan met the second criterion. The Debtors claimed the loan was funded by a nonprofit organization, but this was not adequately substantiated by the record.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe court denied Wells Fargo's Motion for Summary Judgment due to the failure to establish that the loan was made under the auspices of a government unit or nonprofit institution, despite the educational nature of the loan.\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Case Law:\n\n1. **Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986)**: Established that the role of the judge in summary judgment is not to weigh evidence but to determine if there is a genuine issue for trial.\n\n2. **Adickes v.

Supp. 2d 756 (N.D. Ohio 2012)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio  \n**Filed:** October 17, 2012  \n**Precedential Status:** Precedential  \n**Citation:** 904 F. Supp. 2d 756, 78 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (West) 942, 2012 WL 4958516, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149233  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \n\n---\n\n#### Background:\n\nOn October 24, 2008, Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed the vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was subsequently assigned to Defendant Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision, stipulating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms. \n\nIn the event of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\n\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\n\n---\n\n#### Legal Issues:\n\n**I. Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\n\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\n\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections."},

Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections."},

LEXIS 149233  \n**Case Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster\n\n---\n\n#### Background:\n\nOn October 24, 2008, Laneeka White and Timothy Reese, the plaintiffs, purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed this vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was later assigned to Wells Fargo, the defendant. The contract included a provision specifying that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms.\n\nIf the plaintiffs defaulted, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus permissible expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the plaintiffs. Permissible expenses were defined as costs directly incurred from the repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs defaulted in September 2011, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at a public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\n\nThe plaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\n\n---\n\n#### Legal Issues:\n\n**I. Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations. \n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections."},

The contract was governed by federal and Ohio law.\n\nUpon default, the contract allowed Wells Fargo to sell the vehicle and apply the proceeds, minus expenses, to the outstanding amount. Expenses were defined as costs directly incurred from repossession and sale.\n\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and scheduled a public auction.

Wells Fargo then sent a Deficiency Notice, including $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and fees, but later dismissed the case. The Plaintiffs then filed a class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC).

Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nWells Fargo claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nWells Fargo cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nWells Fargo argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations.\n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nWells Fargo contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nWells Fargo sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections."},

LEXIS 149233  \n**Docket Number:** Case No. 1:12 CV 943  \n**Judge:** Dan Aaron Polster  \n\n---\n\n#### Background:\n\nOn October 24, 2008, Plaintiffs Laneeka White and Timothy Reese purchased a vehicle from Cresmont Chrysler Jeep in Beachwood, Ohio. They financed the vehicle through a Retail Installment Sales Contract, which was subsequently assigned to Defendant Wells Fargo. The contract included a choice-of-law provision, stipulating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms. \n\nIn the event of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nIn September 2011, after the Plaintiffs defaulted, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\n\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees.

The court examined three forms of preemption:\n\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations.\n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections."},

The contract was then assigned to Wells Fargo. The contract included a provision stating that federal and Ohio law would govern its terms.\n\nIn case of default, the contract stated that Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the plaintiffs. Expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs defaulted in September 2011, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011. The selling price was $9,600, significantly below the stated minimum bid of $14,850. Following the sale, Wells Fargo sent a Deficiency Notice, which included $1,291.21 in collection fees.\n\nWells Fargo then filed a suit in state court to recover the deficiency and collection fees, but later voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.\n\nThe plaintiffs subsequently filed a putative class action against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Ohio Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) and the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code (OUCC). They claimed Wells Fargo failed to disclose the correct sale date and minimum bid, did not conduct a commercially reasonable sale, and charged prohibited collection fees. They also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought class certification, an injunction against collecting alleged deficiencies, removal of adverse credit reporting, and various forms of damages.\n\n---\n\n#### Legal Issues:\n\n**I. Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint.

Standard of Review:**\nWells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on Rule 12(b)(6), which tests the sufficiency of a complaint. To survive this motion, a complaint must present sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face, as established in *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*.\n\n**II. Statutory Claims:**\nDefendant argued that the statutory claims were preempted by the National Banking Act (NBA) and regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The court examined three forms of preemption:\n\n1. **Express Preemption:** A state law is expressly preempted when federal law explicitly states so (Jones v. Rath Packing Co.).\n2. **Field Preemption:** If Congress extensively regulates an industry, it may occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation (Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n3. **Obstacle Preemption:** A state law may be preempted if it poses an obstacle to the execution of federal law (Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v. Nelson).\n\nDefendant claimed that RISA and OUCC fell under all three categories of preemption.\n\n**A. Express Preemption:**\nThe court noted that RISA and OUCC require creditors to follow specific procedures for repossession and sale. For example, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.12 mandates timely notification to the debtor regarding defaults and sale details. Failure to comply with these requirements prohibits a creditor from recovering costs or obtaining a deficiency judgment.\n\nDefendant cited 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4008(d), asserting it preempted state laws concerning repossession notices. However, the court interpreted the regulation as applying to early-stage loan documentation and not to post-default procedures, concluding that RISA and OUCC are not preempted.\n\n**B. Field Preemption:**\nThe court found no evidence that the OCC regulations claimed full field preemption. It referenced *Aguayo v. U.S. Bank*, noting that the OCC did not occupy the field of debt collection, allowing state laws related to debt collection to remain effective.\n\n**C. Obstacle Preemption:**\nDefendant argued that the state laws obstructed its ability to collect debts. However, the court cited *Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens* and *Epps v. JP Morgan Chase Bank*, which indicated that state laws governing repossession and collection do not interfere with lending operations.\n\n**D. Alternative Argument:**\nDefendant contended that RISA does not apply to transactions between consumers and financial institutions. While this is true, RISA applies to three-party transactions where a retailer extends credit and subsequently assigns the contract to a financial institution (Jones v. Cynet, Inc.; Huntington National Bank v. Elkins). The court determined that this case involved such a three-party transaction, making RISA applicable.\n\n---\n\n#### Breach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment:\n\n**Breach of Contract:**\nDefendant sought dismissal of the breach of contract claim on the basis that the contract expressly allowed for collection fees. The court found the term 'collection fees' ambiguous and determined that further factual development was necessary.\n\n**Unjust Enrichment:**\nIn Ohio, unjust enrichment is typically not allowed if an express contract covers the same subject. However, it may proceed if the defendant acted in bad faith (MMK Group, LLC v. SheShells Co., LLC; Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A.). Plaintiffs alleged bad faith by Wells Fargo in charging prohibited fees. The court concluded that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any dishonest purpose by Wells Fargo, leading to the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed while the unjust enrichment claim was dismissed. The ruling reaffirmed the applicability of state laws regulating repossession and debt collection in consumer transactions, indicating that federal regulations do not preempt these protections."},

The contract was governed by federal and Ohio law.\n\nIn the event of a default, Wells Fargo would sell the vehicle and apply the sale proceeds, minus allowed expenses, to the outstanding amount owed by the Plaintiffs. Allowed expenses were defined as costs incurred directly from repossession and sale of the vehicle.\n\nAfter the Plaintiffs defaulted in September 2011, Wells Fargo repossessed the vehicle and issued a 'Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property,' indicating the vehicle would be sold at public auction. A 'Notice of Intention to Dispose of Motor Vehicle' was also sent, informing the Plaintiffs of their right to redeem the vehicle.\n\nThe public sale was scheduled for October 20, 2011, but actually took place on November 3, 2011.

Wells Fargo Bank NA*, 297 F.R.D. 665 (M.D. Fla. 2014)\n\n**Court:** United States District Court, Middle District of Florida  \n**Filed:** March 26, 2014  \n**Citation:** 297 F.R.D. 665, 2014 WL 1246494  \n**Docket Number:** No. 2:11-cv-695-FtM-29DNF  \n**Judge:** Douglas N. Frazier\n\n#### Background\n\nPlaintiffs Franz Lesti and Petra Richter filed a Motion to Compel Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to produce information regarding Angelika Neumeier-Fuchs, a co-conspirator. The Plaintiffs sought this information in relation to their claims involving alleged financial misconduct. The case revolves around the claim that Wells Fargo facilitated illicit transactions by allowing Fuchs to transfer money from accounts associated with her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts after allegedly discovering suspicious activity.\n\n#### Key Facts\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Request:** The Plaintiffs requested all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, emphasizing the need to understand Wells Fargo's conduct in opening accounts for her, particularly in light of accusations of money laundering.\n\n2. **Defendant's Response:** Wells Fargo objected to the request, citing several reasons:\n   - The request was overly broad and burdensome.\n   - The documents were irrelevant to the case and not likely to lead to admissible evidence.\n   - Assertions of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were made.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were routine and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo claimed that certain documents were protected under the SAR privilege, which prevents the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court noted that supporting documentation generated in the ordinary course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Findings\n\n- The Court ruled that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were relevant and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It limited the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while protecting the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\n- The Court required Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not obligating them to disclose privileged communications.\n\n#### Orders\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **GRANTED IN PART** and **DENIED IN PART**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\n\n2. The Court declined to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Principles\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court emphasized that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The burden of proving a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court distinguished between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\n\nThis ruling underscores the broad scope of discovery in civil litigation while balancing the need for confidentiality in banking operations."},

The lawsuit centers around the allegation that Wells Fargo enabled unlawful transactions by permitting Fuchs to move funds from accounts associated with her business, PCOM, to her personal accounts, even after allegedly detecting suspicious activity.\n\n#### Significant Facts\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Petition:** The Plaintiffs sought all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, highlighting the necessity to comprehend Wells Fargo's actions in establishing accounts for her, especially in the context of money laundering allegations.\n\n2. **Defendant's Position:** Wells Fargo opposed the request, citing several reasons:\n   - The request was excessively broad and onerous.\n   - The documents were not pertinent to the case and unlikely to lead to admissible evidence.\n   - Claims of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were raised.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts under scrutiny were standard and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo asserted that certain documents were safeguarded under the SAR privilege, which prohibits the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court pointed out that supporting documentation created in the normal course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Decisions\n\n- The Court determined that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were pertinent and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The case revolves around the claim that Wells Fargo facilitated illicit transactions by allowing Fuchs to transfer money from accounts associated with her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts after allegedly discovering suspicious activity.\n\n#### Key Facts\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Request:** The Plaintiffs requested all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, emphasizing the need to understand Wells Fargo's conduct in opening accounts for her, particularly in light of accusations of money laundering.\n\n2. **Defendant's Response:** Wells Fargo objected to the request, citing several reasons:\n   - The request was overly broad and burdensome.\n   - The documents were irrelevant to the case and not likely to lead to admissible evidence.\n   - Assertions of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were made.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were routine and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo claimed that certain documents were protected under the SAR privilege, which prevents the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court noted that supporting documentation generated in the ordinary course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Findings\n\n- The Court ruled that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were relevant and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It limited the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while protecting the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\n- The Court required Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not obligating them to disclose privileged communications.\n\n#### Orders\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **GRANTED IN PART** and **DENIED IN PART**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\n\n2. The Court declined to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Principles\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court emphasized that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The burden of proving a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court distinguished between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\n\nThis ruling underscores the broad scope of discovery in civil litigation while balancing the need for confidentiality in banking operations."},

The case revolves around the claim that Wells Fargo facilitated illicit transactions by allowing Fuchs to transfer money from accounts associated with her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts after allegedly discovering suspicious activity.\n\n#### Key Facts\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Request:** The Plaintiffs requested all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, emphasizing the need to understand Wells Fargo's conduct in opening accounts for her, particularly in light of accusations of money laundering.\n\n2. **Defendant's Response:** Wells Fargo objected to the request, citing several reasons:\n   - The request was overly broad and burdensome.\n   - The documents were irrelevant to the case and not likely to lead to admissible evidence.\n   - Assertions of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were made.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were routine and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo claimed that certain documents were protected under the SAR privilege, which prevents the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court noted that supporting documentation generated in the ordinary course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Findings\n\n- The Court ruled that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were relevant and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It limited the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while protecting the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\n- The Court required Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not obligating them to disclose privileged communications.\n\n#### Orders\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **GRANTED IN PART** and **DENIED IN PART**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\n\n2. The Court declined to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Principles\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court emphasized that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The burden of proving a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court distinguished between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\n\nThis ruling underscores the broad scope of discovery in civil litigation while balancing the need for confidentiality in banking operations."},

The case revolves around the claim that Wells Fargo facilitated illicit transactions by allowing Fuchs to transfer money from accounts associated with her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts after allegedly discovering suspicious activity.\n\n#### Key Facts\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Request:** The Plaintiffs requested all documents related to Angelika Neumeier, emphasizing the need to understand Wells Fargo's conduct in opening accounts for her, particularly in light of accusations of money laundering.\n\n2. **Defendant's Response:** Wells Fargo objected to the request, citing several reasons:\n   - The request was overly broad and burdensome.\n   - The documents were irrelevant to the case and not likely to lead to admissible evidence.\n   - Assertions of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were made.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were routine and closed shortly after opening, asserting that the Plaintiffs could have obtained information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Privilege:** Wells Fargo claimed that certain documents were protected under the SAR privilege, which prevents the disclosure of SARs or information that reveals their existence. However, the Court noted that supporting documentation generated in the ordinary course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Findings\n\n- The Court ruled that the documents relating to Fuchs' accounts were relevant and could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It limited the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while protecting the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\n- The Court required Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not obligating them to disclose privileged communications.\n\n#### Orders\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **GRANTED IN PART** and **DENIED IN PART**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had obtained a waiver after the depositions.\n\n2. The Court declined to award any sanctions or fees to the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Principles\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court emphasized that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The burden of proving a lack of relevance lies with the party objecting to the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court distinguished between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\n\nThis ruling underscores the broad scope of discovery in civil litigation while balancing the need for confidentiality in banking operations."},

The case hinges on the allegation that Wells Fargo enabled unlawful transactions by permitting Fuchs to transfer funds from accounts linked to her company, PCOM, to her personal accounts, despite purportedly detecting dubious activity.\n\n#### Pivotal Details\n\n1. **Plaintiffs' Motion:** The Plaintiffs sought all documents concerning Angelika Neumeier, stressing the necessity of comprehending Wells Fargo's actions in opening accounts for her, especially considering the allegations of money laundering.\n\n2. **Defendant's Position:** Wells Fargo contested the motion, offering several justifications:\n   - The motion was excessively broad and onerous.\n   - The documents were immaterial to the case and unlikely to yield admissible evidence.\n   - Claims of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine were invoked.\n   - The bank argued that the accounts in question were standard and closed shortly after opening, suggesting that the Plaintiffs could have procured information directly from Fuchs.\n\n3. **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Protection:** Wells Fargo asserted that certain documents were shielded by the SAR privilege, which prohibits the disclosure of SARs or information revealing their existence. However, the Court pointed out that supporting documentation created in the normal course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Conclusions\n\n- The Court determined that the documents pertaining to Fuchs' accounts were pertinent and could potentially uncover admissible evidence. It restricted the scope of the request to factual documents, such as transaction records, while safeguarding the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal discussions related to them.\n- The Court mandated Wells Fargo to produce business records related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not compelling them to reveal privileged communications.\n\n#### Court Orders\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **GRANTED IN PART** and **DENIED IN PART**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was directed to furnish specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The Court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the Plaintiffs had secured a waiver following the depositions.\n\n2. The Court decided against awarding any penalties or fees to the Plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Standards\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The Court highlighted that pertinent information is discoverable, even if it is not directly admissible in court. The onus of demonstrating a lack of relevance falls on the party objecting to the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents like *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the Court differentiated between factual documents that can be disclosed and those protected under SAR privilege.\n\nThis decision underscores the extensive scope of discovery in civil litigation while maintaining the necessity for confidentiality in banking operations."},

However, the court noted that supporting documentation created in the usual course of business is discoverable.\n\n#### Court's Conclusions\n\n- The court determined that the records related to Fuchs' accounts were pertinent and could potentially lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It narrowed the scope of the request to factual records, such as transaction records, while preserving the SAR privilege regarding drafts of SARs or internal communications related to them.\n- The court mandated Wells Fargo to produce business records pertaining to Fuchs\u2019 accounts while not compelling them to disclose privileged communications.\n\n#### Directives\n\n1. The Motion to Compel was **PARTIALLY GRANTED** and **PARTIALLY DENIED**:\n   - **Granted**: Wells Fargo was ordered to produce specific documents related to Fuchs\u2019 accounts within 21 days.\n   - **Denied**: The court did not require Wells Fargo to provide answers to deposition questions regarding Fuchs\u2019 accounts, as the plaintiffs had secured a waiver after the depositions.\n\n2. The court declined to impose any penalties or fees on Wells Fargo in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\n#### Legal Doctrines\n\n- **Discovery Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26**: The court emphasized that relevant information is discoverable, even if not directly admissible at trial. The onus of demonstrating a lack of relevance lies with the party opposing the discovery.\n- **SAR Privilege**: Following precedents such as *Union Bank of California v. Superior Court* and *Regions Bank v. Allen*, the court differentiated between factual records that can be disclosed and those safeguarded under SAR privilege."},
